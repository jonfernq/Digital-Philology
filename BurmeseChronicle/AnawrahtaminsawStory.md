## Anawrahtaminsaw (1017-1059)

After Anawrahtaminsaw killed his elder brother, he sought his father's blessing to become king. Despite his father's initial reluctance due to his old age, Anawrahtaminsaw was anointed king in the year 879. He also made his father the monk-king, who was surrounded by women who served him in the monastery. Although the chronicles did not explicitly state that Anawrahtaminsaw ascended the throne in 879, an inscription in a pagoda built by his queen indicated that he became king on Monday, the eighth day after the full moon of Pyatho, in the year carawun 379.

After killing his elder brother, Anawrahtaminsaw was plagued by guilt and unable to sleep for six months. However, he received a visit from Sakra in a dream, who advised him to build many pagodas, monasteries, and resthouses, and share the merit with his elder brother to atone for his sin. Additionally, Sakra suggested that Anawrahtaminsaw should build many wells, ponds, dams, ditches, fields, and canals and share the merit with his elder brother.

Anawrahtaminsaw's reign was characterized by righteous governance, which he executed with his prince, queen, and ministers, both great and small. Despite his past misdeeds, Anawrahtaminsaw sought to make amends and built many structures to benefit his people and share merit with his deceased elder brother.

### Princess Pancakalyani

The story of Princess Pancakalyani dates back to a time when the king of an unknown land was in search of a princess worthy of him. He dispatched a royal envoy with gifts and presents to find a suitable princess beyond the borders of Jambudipa, in addition to Sawlu's mother. The envoy scoured high and low for a princess that met the king's criteria. Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Vesali in the Middle Country, Princess Sanghamitta, the eldest of seven daughters, was practicing piety with some saintly nuns in a garden. The nun Sanghamitta had planted a bael tree that produced a fruit as large as a jar. When the fruit fell, a beautiful young daughter, with all the signs of royalty, emerged from it. The saintly nuns offered the daughter to the king of Vesali, who named her Ruciyapabhavati and married her to his son and heir, who later became the king. Ruciyapabhavati gave birth to a daughter called Pancakalyani, who was kept in a pyatthad with a single post.

Later, when the envoy heard of Princess Pancakalyani's existence, he offered a vast amount of gifts and presents to the king of Vesali to ask for her hand in marriage on behalf of the ruler of Paukkarama, Anawrahtaminsaw, who had no queen. The king of Vesali agreed and gave the princess away with a troop of eighty handmaidens. They traveled together until they arrived at Dhafifiavati, where the envoy left one of the attendants behind in turn at each town and village to avoid being discovered by the king of Paukkarama.

When the king of Paukkarama learned of their arrival, he went to meet them with his fourfold army, received the gifts, and returned home with his army. However, the envoy who had brought Princess Pancakalyani spoke ill of her background and claimed that she was not the daughter of the king of Vesali. The king of Paukkarama, believing the envoy's words, became angry and lodged the princess in the West Chamber and gave her in charge to his minister at Pareimma.

In summary, Princess Pancakalyani's story is one of royal intrigue and deception. Despite being a princess with all the signs of royalty, she was treated unfairly due to the slanderous words of a royal envoy. Her true identity was not revealed, leaving her to live a life of confinement and isolation.

### Kyanzittha

The story of Kyanzittha's birth is fraught with peril and mystery. According to legend, when his mother, Princess Pancakalyani, reached Pareimma, an earthquake shook the land, and Nawrahtaminsaw, the king and father of the child in her womb, consulted his masters of white and black magic to discover the cause. They whispered in his ear that a future king had been conceived in the north, and so the king ordered the execution of over 7,000 pregnant women in the north quarter, hoping to prevent the birth of his rival. However, Kyanzittha's mother was hidden by a Naga youth and escaped death.

As Kyanzittha grew in his mother's womb, the king's fear intensified, and he ordered the execution of over 6,000 suckling babes in the cradle and then over 5,000 children of the age of cowboys. Despite the king's efforts, Kyanzittha was hidden by the Naga youth and remained alive. Chronicles differ on how Kyanzittha received his name; some suggest that it was because he was left over and not counted among the slain, while others claim that the king himself gave him the name Kyanzittha.

While some believe that Kyanzittha was the son of a Naga, the inscription of the Hlédauk pagoda, built by his grandson Alaungsithu, clearly states that Kyanzittha was the beloved son of Anawrahtaminsaw, descended from a line of kings. The theory that Kyanzittha was the son of a Naga is deemed false, as the Naga youth protected him not because he was his father, but because he saw in him a man of great glory and power who would uphold the great religion through his authority.

Moreover, it is believed that the princess Pancakalyani was sent to Pareimma only after she reached the royal abode and worshipped the golden palace. Kyanzittha built the Pahsittop pagoda in her honor when he became king, saying, "Here my mother sank upon her knees!" This suggests that Kyanzittha was born in the royal abode and not in Pareimma. Other legends speak of the protection of young princes and queens by Nagas and hamadryads, highlighting the belief in supernatural forces that could protect individuals deemed important to the future of their kingdoms.

During the reign of King Anawrahta, a fascinating tale emerged of how Kyanzittha came to be recognized as the king's own son and eventually became a layman in the royal court. According to the story, Kyanzittha's mother entrusted her son to the king's chaplain and he became a monk. However, the masters of white magic and black magic warned the king that Kyanzittha would become king in the future. To confirm this prediction, the king invited all the monks in order to a meal and offered them water in a water-pot. When Kyanzittha drank the water, a radiant wheel-mark appeared from his mouth, confirming the prophecy of the masters. The king, who was initially shocked and remorseful for having killed many, realized that Kyanzittha was his own son and took pity on him by making him a layman in the royal court.

Kyanzittha later proved to be an excellent leader, and the king heard of Nga Htweyu's ability to climb and cut the fruit of a thousand palm trees in a given time, Nga Lonlephpé's ability to harness and drive threescore yoke of oxen in a straight furrow, and Nyaung-u Hpi's ability to run down from a cliff, swim across a river, and climb back up without touching the shore. The king then brought these skilled individuals to Kyanzittha's side, and they became known as his men. Together, they were tasked with catching four demon horses that were wandering around without an owner. The four heroes created a fenced pathway into a yard filled with water and managed to catch the horses by swimming with them. The king was impressed with their success and rewarded them by giving them the horses and the responsibility of bearing his yoke. The demon horses were named Kandikalek-hla, Hnalonhkungaung, Lemoyihkaung, Hnalonlyintaing, and Hnalonatumashi, and they became legendary symbols of Kyanzittha's heroic deeds.

In the year 1021, during the fourth year of Anawrahtasaw's reign, his father, King Kyaungbyu, passed away at the age of 115. The Great Chronicle indicates that Anawrahtaminsaw became king in the year 964, and in his fourth year, King Kyaungbyu died. However, the inscription of the Mahti monastery, which was built and dedicated to Kyaungbyu by Anawrahtaminsaw, suggests that Kyaungbyu died 14 years before the monastery's construction in the year 882. The inscriptions in various places, as well as the New Chronicle, support the claim that Anawrahtasaw became king in 329, built the Mahti monastery three years later, and Kyaungbyu passed away one year after the monastery's completion. The Great Royal Chronicle, which was compiled after consulting learned monks, brahmans, and ministers and written in the sacred chamber in front of the royal Palace of Glass, concludes its third part at this point. The author of the Chronicle describes the reigning king as the sovereign of umbrella-holding kings of diverse great kingdoms and countries, the builder of the fourth city of Ratanapura and the palace, lord of the Asaddan king of elephants, lord and master of white elephants, lord of the universe, and great captain of the law.

### Heretical Ari Monks

In the fourth part of the Great Royal Chronicle, we learn about the reign of Anawrahtaminsaw and the state of the kingdom known as Pugarama (Pagan). The text describes how the kings of the country for many generations were misled by false opinions and practices propagated by the Ari monks who rejected the teachings of Lord Buddha and formulated their own doctrines. They wrote books that contradicted the true law and misled others into following their misguided beliefs. For instance, they preached that a person could evade the course of Aarma and even kill their parents and evade the course of darma if they recited the formula of deprecation.

Furthermore, the text explains how the Ari monks compelled people of all social classes, including kings and ministers, to send their children to them for worship, which involved an act of sending the flower of virginity. This act had become a custom and was punished if not followed. The text clarifies that this custom was connected with the phrase vikaramaho, which meant "sending to the monastery to worship," and scholars used it in their stone inscriptions to denote the "time of the first sending to the monastery."

However, King Anawrahtaminsaw was different. The text describes him as a king of ripe perfections who was displeased when he heard about these wrong and lawless doings. He knew them for what they were and yearned to discover the true Law.

### Shin Arahan 

In 11th century CE, Shin Arahan or Dhammadassi, a noble saint from Sudhammavati (the kingdom of Thaton), arrived at Pagan. Certain noble saints, who perceived that Buddhism had not yet spread in the kingdoms of the Western Country and Tampadipa, approached Sakra for help to entreat someone who can build the religion. Sakra entreated a spirit in Tavatimsa, a country of spirits, who then agreed to be conceived in the womb of a Brahmani. The child born was the noble saint called Silabuddhi, who later became a monk, learned the books of the Pitakas, and attained saintship. Silabuddhi, also known as Arahan, went to Pugarama and lived in a forest near the capital. Sakra then prevailed upon a certain hunter to bring Shin Arahan to the capital, and the hunter presented him before the king with the eight things needed.

When the king saw Shin Arahan, he was impressed and asked about his race, where he came from, and whose doctrine he followed. Shin Arahan revealed that he was of the Lord Buddha's race, and he followed the doctrine of the sermon of authority preached by Lord Buddha. The king was full of joy and requested him to preach about the Lord's Law. Shin Arahan preached the Law, and the king's heart was filled with faith. The king asked about Lord Buddha's whereabouts and about the sum of the Law preached by the Lord. Shin Arahan replied that Lord Buddha had attained mastery near the great Wisdom Tree and for forty-five whole rain-seasons, he exhorted all beings in his great pity and compassion. Lord Buddha entered parinirvana after that, causing all world-elements to quake in the ingyin garden in the kingdom of Kusinara. Eleven kings took the eight holy relics of his body and severally worshipped them. Seven of these relics were brought to king Siridhammasoka, who built fourscore and four thousand pagodas. One portion of the relics was taken away and hidden in the stomach of Naga, while the novice Sumana found another portion and offered it to Abhayadutthagamani, ruler of Ceylon island, who built a great zedi. Sakra took the upper right tooth and worshipped it in Tavatimsa, while Nagas took away the lower right tooth and worshipped it in the Naga country. 

The Great Chronicle and the Dathadhatuvamsa disagree on the location of the upper left tooth, as the former claims it was in the island of Ceylon. According to the Dathadhatuvamsa, the religious sermons written by certain members of the Order were presented thrice before the Councils in the Middle Country, inscribed on palm-leaf in the island of Ceylon, and offered to the king of Thaton. Thirty sets of Pitakas were available in Thaton. When Ashin Arahan preached the Law to Anawrahta-minsaw, the latter was filled with faith and pledged his body and life to him. He rejected the doctrines of the Ari heretics and built a monastery in the forest for Ashin Arahan. The lineage of Shin Arahan is traced back to Ashin Upali, the pupil of the Lord Omniscient, and ends with Byanadassi. The Ari lords, who lost their gain and honour after the king and people were established in the good Law, bore great hatred against Shin Arahan, prompting the king to appoint guards to defeat them. The king unfrocked the thirty Ari lords and their sixty thousand followers and enrolled them among his spearmen, lancers, and elephant dung-sweepers.

The Kala Brothers

This passage tells the story of two Kala brothers who were shipwrecked near Thaton and found refuge with the chaplain of the Thaton king. The chaplain took them under his wing and showed them great kindness. One day, while collecting herbs for medicine in the forest, the chaplain discovered the dead body of a fakir with mystic wisdom. The chaplain believed that by eating the fakir's flesh, one could gain incredible strength and longevity. The younger Kala brother followed the chaplain's advice and gained extraordinary strength, which eventually led to his death at the hands of the Thaton king. The elder brother was killed while he was asleep in his wife's house. The younger brother fled to Pugarama and found refuge with Anawrahtaminsaw, who saw the Kala's potential and kept him close. Later, the Kala was sent to Poppa to fetch saga flowers and was seduced by an ogress who gave birth to two sons. Anawrahtaminsaw kept the sons, Shwehpyigyi and Shwehpyingé, close to him due to their impressive looks and bearing. The chaplain of the Thaton king advised the king to bury the body parts of the younger Kala brother in various locations with specific charms and rites, which would protect the kingdom of Thaton from its enemies.

### Thaton & the Three Pitakas 

In 11th-century Burma, King Anawrahta embarked on a mission to obtain the Three Pitakas, the essential scriptures of the Lord's religion. According to Shin Arahan, a prominent Buddhist monk, the religion cannot last long without the scriptures. After learning that thirty sets of the Pitakas were kept in the city of Thaton, Anawrahta dispatched a minister to request them with gifts and presents. However, the king of Thaton responded ill, causing Anawrahta to amass a massive army of eight million horses, eighteen million fighting men, and eight hundred thousand elephants. The army traveled by land and water, with Anawrahta marching in the rear with the main army and four generals leading the van.

When Anawrahta's army arrived at the city of Thaton, they faced resistance from the fortified city walls and the charms that had been devised to protect it. Anawrahta sought advice from his masters of black and white magic, who revealed that victory could only be achieved by retrieving and destroying the head, hands, and thighs of a long-dead man. The Kala footrunner, who had a personal vendetta against the deceased man, retrieved the body parts and offered them to Anawrahta. The bones were then ceremoniously dropped into the sea. With the charms weakened, Anawrahta's army entered the city and captured the king of Thaton, along with his family and ministers.

Anawrahta seized the sacred relics and thirty sets of the Pitakas, which he placed on thirty-two white elephants for the journey back to Pugarama. He also selected skilled craftsmen in various fields, such as carving, painting, and masonry, to join his entourage. Additionally, he brought along individuals with expertise in various arts, such as hairdressing and flower arrangements, as well as doctors and trainers of elephants and horses. Anawrahta made a fair appeal to the noble Order, urging them to join him in his quest for the Pitakas. After successfully obtaining the Pitakas and other valuable assets, Anawrahta returned to Pugarama with the captured king of Thaton and his family.

### History of Thaton 

The historical account of Thaton begins with the reign of King Siharaja, who was the first ruler of the kingdom during the lifetime of Lord Buddha. Following him, forty-eight consecutive kings, including Manuha, governed the kingdom and upheld the Lord's religion. The people of Thaton were virtuous and charitable, resulting in a prosperous and pleasant kingdom. However, Manuha's reign came to a disastrous end when he insulted the envoys sent by King Anawrahta, leading to the ruin of the entire country.

According to the Great Chronicle, King Asokadhammaraja ruled Thaton during Lord Buddha's lifetime. In contrast, the Thaton Chronicle narrates a different story of Lord Buddha's visit to Thaton, during the reign of Siharaja, who was Ashin Gavampati's brother. Ashin Gavampati invited Lord Buddha to Thaton, where he presented the thirty-two tooth-relics for the king to worship. King Siharaja ruled for sixty years and passed away ten years after Lord Buddha's parinirvana, succeeded by his son Sirimasoka.

### King Manuha in Pagan 

Anawrahtaminsaw, upon reaching Pugarama, established separate quarters for the mighty and learned men. He enshrined all the relics of Lord Buddha's sacred body in a ruby casket and kept them near his bed, where he worshipped them. He also kept the thirty sets of Pitakas in a pyatthad and instructed the noble Order to impart knowledge. King Manuha lived in Myinkaba and was renowned for spouting radiant wheels from his mouth while speaking. When Manuha visited and bowed before Anawrahtaminsaw, the king was astounded, and his hair stood on end. To reduce Manuha's glory and power, Anawrahtaminsaw had his food prepared on a jeweled salver, first dedicated to a pagoda, and then set before him. King Manuha ate it without scrutiny, and his radiant wheel vanished. Stricken with remorse, he built a colossal Buddha and prayed to never be conquered by another, naming the temple after himself, where it remains to this day.

Mission to Gandara for Tooth Relic 

In 1044 CE, Anawrahta, the ruler of the Pagan Empire, embarked on a mission to the Tarop country in the kingdom of Gandhala to acquire a holy tooth that he believed would bring prosperity to his empire. He gathered his army, including elephants, horses, and 72 million fighting men, and summoned the four riders on demon horses and the Shwehpyi brothers. When he arrived, the Tarop Utibwa [Chinese ruler] refused to open the city gate, and Anawrahta decided to investigate the matter. He met the hermit, the chaplain of the Utibwa, who was surrounded by 100,000 followers. The hermit did not recognize Anawrahta, so the king used his Areindama cane to turn seven seats into one and sat on it. The hermit then knew he was in the presence of a great king and asked why he had come. Anawrahta revealed his desire to acquire the holy tooth of the Lord Omniscient. The Utibwa, who worshiped the tooth, did not acknowledge Anawrahta or his army. Anawrahta ordered the Shwehpyi brothers to enter the Utibwa's palace, suck out the water from the wheel engine, and mark three lines on the Utibwa's body. They also left a message on the wall threatening to cut the Utibwa along the lines if he continued to ignore Anawrahta's presence. The next morning, Anawrahta commanded Kyanzittha to tie a rope around the copper Sandi spirit and strike it with the Areindama cane, and the image was destroyed. Finally, the Utibwa opened the gate and allowed Anawrahta to take the sacred tooth, which he brought back to the Pagan Empire, where it became an object of worship for all beings.

During his visit to Maw [Tai, Shan], Anawrahta was greeted by the Sawbwa, ruler of the nine provinces of Maw, who laid out five golden mats in reverence to the king. Anawrahta struck the mats with the Areindama cane, causing them to pile upon one another as a symbol of his power and glory, and he then rested upon them. The Sawbwa was so impressed by this display of strength that he offered Anawrahta his daughter, Sawmunhla, who possessed the five virtues. Anawrahta accepted the offer and returned home by water and land.

Later, when Anawrahta arrived in Kyawzi, he put to death the Shwehpyi brothers at Wayindot, believing them to be untrustworthy. The place where they were killed is still known as Kupya banyan tree. Anawrahta also built a gu at Taungbyon, which he called Hsutaungpyi, with the intention of ensuring that the religion would last for five thousand years. He then returned home on the royal raft, but the Shwehpyi brothers, who had become evil spirits, kept catching the rudder, preventing the raft from moving. Anawrahta sought advice from his white and black magic masters, who informed him that the Nga Hpyi brothers had served him faithfully but were now haunting him. As a result, Anawrahta ordered the construction of the spirit-palace at the Hsutaungpyi pagoda, which was to be worshipped by people throughout Kyawzi.

Despite Anawrahta's high regard for Sawmunhla, his continuous keeping of her near him caused concern among the queen and concubines when they saw colors emanating from the holy relic in her earring. They accused Sawmunhla of being a yogani, a witch, and Anawrahta, upon seeing the colors, believed them. He dismissed Sawmunhla, ordering her to return to her city-village home, despite her humble obedience to the king and the guardian spirit of the kingdom and the palace.

### Sawmunhla's Lost Earring 

The Shwezayan pagoda has a miraculous origin story. According to legend, Sawmunhla, while travelling to various villages, lost her earring near the site where the pagoda now stands. Despite attempts to find the earring in the water, it could not be located. However, young sparrows appeared and gathered around a sacred relic with the earring that had miraculously appeared in the sky. Sawmunhla recognized the significance of this event and decided to build a pagoda to enshrine the holy relic. Sakra revealed a heap of bricks for the construction, and Sawmunhla built a cave-temple with an image five cubits tall.

When King Anawrahtaminsaw heard about the pagoda, he sent royal messengers to inspect it. If the entrance to the cave-temple faced east towards the Shan country of Maw, Sawmunhla would be executed. However, if it faced the royal home of Pugarama, she would be spared. Sawmunhla cleverly delayed hearing the king's sentence until the next morning, giving her time to offer gifts and bribes to the messengers. She also asked them questions to find out the purport of the king's letter, and learned the truth. With the help of Sakra and other spirits, Sawmunhla was able to miraculously alter the orientation of the pagoda's entrance to face west, which saved her life.

Over the years, the Shwezayan pagoda was repaired and renovated by subsequent kings and queens. King Alaungsithu made offerings to the pagoda and appointed caretakers to maintain it, while later monarchs raised the image to an even greater height and added golden embellishments. Although the Great Chronicle and the Middle Chronicle do not mention the Shwezayan pagoda, this history is included in the Great Royal Chronicle of Pagan Shwezigon and Shwezayan.

### Relics Enshrined at Shwezigon pagoda

In the year 185, the relics of the sacred frontlet and the tooth were brought to the Shwezigon pagoda and enshrined. This event followed the destruction of Tharehkittara by Anawrahta, who led a large army of elephants and horses by land and water. The zedi built by King Dwattabaung was destroyed, and the frontlet-relic was taken by Anawrahta and placed on a white elephant with a pyatthad adorned with gems. The origin of this relic is the subject of much debate among scholars.

The Nalatadhatuvamsa tells of the frontlet-relic being received by the Malla kings as their share at the time of the Lord’s parinirvana. It was then passed down from teacher to teacher until it came into the hands of King Mahanaga in Ceylon island. However, the Arakan Chronicle and the Mahamuni Thamaing claim that Anawrahta took the frontlet-relic from Arakan during his reign. The conflict between these two statements can be explained by considering the nalata relic to be the forehead-relic and the umAissa relic to be the frontlet-relic.

Anawrahta's destruction of Tharehkittara was motivated by his fear that rebels might occupy the city in the future. He also dug up the nawarat boat of the nine gems, which had been used by King Dwattabaung and buried by his son Dwattaran, and buried it again after beholding it. He then returned to his homeland in Pugarama. Despite the discrepancies among sources regarding the frontlet-relic, the Burmese Chronicles, which are based on lines of tradition and are concerned with Burmese history, should be considered the most reliable.

In the building of Shwezigon Pagoda, King Anawrahtaminsaw consulted with the noble saint Ashin Arahan, expressing his desire that the religion would last for five thousand years for the benefit of all beings. To ensure this, he set the frontlet-relic on a jeweled white elephant and made a solemn vow, releasing the elephant and stating that it should kneel in the place where the holy relic was to rest. The white elephant knelt on a sandbank, which was the site of the Shwezigon pagoda, and when the king saw this, he was saddened as he had thought the religion would last five thousand years on natural soil rather than on shifting sand. However, Sakra appeared to him in a dream, assuring him that the religion would stand firm for five thousand years. Thus, the king built the pagoda, and Sakra strengthened the ground with solid rock and iron plates. The Lord's frontlet-relic adorned itself with the greater and lesser signs and six rays and rose all-glorious with grace transcendent, shouldering the eight priestly requisites, ascended the sky, and prophesied that in days to come, the king would be Lord like the relic. The king was overwhelmed with joy and cast the golden image of one embracing the gem-embroidered casket, as advised by Shin Arahan, and enshrined it.

There are two accounts of the building of Shwezigon, namely, the thamaing and the inscriptions. The sandbank where Shwezigon stands is called Zeyagon, and all zedi after its likeness are called Zigon. The Ekakkhara Kosa sub-commentary speaks of the enshrinement of the tooth, collarbone, and frontlet in Shwezigon. Additionally, Nawadegyi wrote a yadu in honor of Shwezigon pagoda, which mentions the sacred relics, including the tooth, collarbone, and frontlet, which were all-glorious and richly dight.

In this historical account, we learn that King Anawrahta desired to obtain the holy tooth from Ceylon to enshrine it in the newly-built Shwezigon pagoda. He sought counsel from his four generals and Kyanzittha proposed that they should attack not only Ceylon but all the other umbrella-holding kings of Jambudipa who might unite against them. With the support of his ministers, Anawrahta sets out on this mission. Meanwhile, Sakra had given Dhatusena, the King of Ceylon, a dream warning him that Anawrahta would take away the sacred tooth and later that night, Sakra transported Anawrahta and his followers to Lokananda where he gave him a dream to send an embassy to request the holy tooth. Anawrahta followed Sakra's advice and sent a white elephant as a present and asked for the holy tooth through an able minister. When Dhatusena received the envoy, he was pleased to hear Anawrahta's request and personally took him to the pyatthad where the holy tooth was kept. He pleaded with great honour and reverence, and the holy tooth adorned itself with the thirty-two greater and eighty lesser signs and the six rays of noble men, and rose all-glorious with grace transcendent. When the Ceylon king saw this, he was full of joy and tenderness, and he pleaded with reverence, and then the holy tooth gave way to another tooth.

In the historical account, Shin Arahan advised King Anawrahtaminsaw to construct a zedi, a pagoda, where all individuals could worship for the duration of the religion's full five thousand years. This was deemed more appropriate than maintaining the holy tooth within the palace and worshipping it there. As a result, King Anawrahtaminsaw placed the holy tooth on a jeweled pyathad, which was mounted on a jeweled white elephant and set free, stating, "Kneel wheresoever it be pleased to rest!" The white elephant ultimately knelt at Shwezigon, where the frontlet-relic was enshrined, and the king enshrined the holy tooth there. The king made a solemn vow that if he were to attain Buddhahood, another holy tooth would proceed from the first. Another tooth emerged, and he placed it on the white elephant, set it free, and made a solemn vow that it could kneel wherever it chose to rest. The white elephant knelt at the top of Mt. Tangyi, where the king constructed a zedi and enshrined the tooth. The king made yet another solemn vow, and the white elephant knelt at Lokananda, where the king built another zedi and enshrined the tooth. Another tooth emerged, and the king placed it on the white elephant, set it free, and the elephant knelt on Mt. Tuywin. The king built another zedi there and enshrined the tooth. The king repeated this process, and the white elephant knelt on Mt. Thalyaung, Mt. Hkaywe, and Mt. Pyek, where the king built a zedi and enshrined each tooth. The king built several zedis to preserve the sacred body's relics, aiming to sustain the religion for five thousand years for the benefit of all beings. He bestowed great honor and reverence upon the five holy teeth and called forth his blessings upon them. This narrative reveals King Anawrahtaminsaw's commitment to the Buddhist faith and his desire to ensure that all individuals had the opportunity to worship and benefit from the religion for an extended period.

In the historical account, it is reported that an army of Gywan warriors marched towards Ussa Pegu, prompting King Anawrabtaminsaw to send four hundred thousand horsemen to aid in the war. However, only four captains - Kyanzittha, Nga Htweyu, Nga Lonlephpé, and Nyaung-u Hpi - disguised as spirits with their followers and eighty Kala footrunners arrived at Ussa Pegu. Upon their arrival, the Ussa Pegu king was displeased with the small number of horsemen that came to help, but the four captains displayed their impressive skills and prowess, earning the admiration of the king and his people.

When the Gywan army arrived with their horses and elephants, the four captains charged into their midst on demon horses and divided them into four divisions. They captured the generals of each division and caused the Gywan warriors to flee in fear. The four demon horsemen presented the captured generals to the Ussa king, who was extremely pleased with their victory and rewarded them accordingly.

### Kyanzittha Sleeps with the King's Princess 

Princess Manisanda, daughter of the Ussa king and a sacred relic were sent to Anawrahtaminsaw as a gift. Princess Manisanda was described as the favorite daughter of the king, of golden color, and weighed the same as an image of a lion. The four demon horsemen, including Kyanzittha, took turns carrying the princess. During Kyanzittha's watch, he slept with the princess, and it was discovered that her weight was greater than that of the lion-image. Kyanzittha's fellow captains reported this to Anawrahtaminsaw, leading to Kyanzittha's punishment, which included being bound with ropes and thrown at with the Areindama lance. Kyanzittha managed to escape, thanks to his karma, and fled towards the Nyaungzi gate.

As Kyanzittha fled, the king sent seven Kala footrunners to pursue and kill him. However, the footrunners believed that they could only catch him while he was sleeping. When Kyanzittha became exhausted and tried to rest in the forest, the Areindama lance he carried would not stay upright. In frustration, Kyanzittha threw the lance into the forest, not realizing that it had struck and killed the seven footrunners hiding in the bushes. When he saw the dead footrunners, he believed that the king had intended to have him killed, leading him to head north to Kyaungbyu.

### Thambula Meets Kyanzittha

In this account, we learn of Thambula, a beautiful and royal niece of a learned monk named maati. The monk had predicted that Thambula would meet her future husband, a man of glory, on a certain day when he would arrive from the south-west and ask for water. When Kyanzittha arrived at the place on the predicted day, he asked Thambula for water and proceeded to eat a lime which he had plucked with his Areindama lance. When maAti tasted the lime after Kyanzittha, he was surprised by its sweetness and concluded that Kyanzittha was a man of glory. Thambula offered Kyanzittha food and drink, and after he had partaken, he requested that she minister to him. Thambula consented and served him well. This encounter between Thambula and Kyanzittha, as predicted by maAti, led to their eventual marriage.

Anawrahtaminsaw erected a pagoda called Mahapeinne, over the sacred hair-relic offered by the Ussa king. The destruction of a zedi built by Balika, one of the brothers Taphussa and Balika, was carried out by King Dwattabaung. He took the four hairs and built a cedi at Tharehkittara, where he worshipped them. When Tharehkittara was destroyed, the Talaing kings dismantled the zedi and moved the four hairs. Two of the hairs were enshrined in the Shwemawdaw pagoda, one at Kyaikko, and the Talaing kings kept one hair in a gem-embroidered casket in the palace. However, according to the Nalatadhatuvamsa, Jeyasena, the Naga king, stole two sacred hairs, and Taphussa and Balika did not notice it. During King Kakavanna's reign on the island of Ceylon, certain noble saints took the hairs from the casket hidden in the belly of the Naga and enshrined them in the Mahamangala pagoda in Lake Seru.

Furthermore, Anawrahta dedicated Manuha, the Talaing king, and all his family attendants to the Shwezigon pagoda as a work of merit. Manuha was the head of his family, and this act was considered a significant religious event during the reign of Anawrahtaminsaw.

In the court of King Anawrahta, chief queen Aggamahesi gave birth to her only son, Sawlu. Her entourage of handmaids consisted of five hundred daughters of chief ministers, each wearing livery crowned with ruby, and with hair styled in the su/i fashion. Additionally, there were five hundred daughters of ministers wearing livery crowned with emerald and with hair styled in the yakin-nyit fashion. Another five hundred daughters of ministers wearing livery crowned with diamond and hair styled in the yakin-ucha fashion also served the queen. The four daughters of rich men wore livery crowned with pearl, while fifty humpbacked women and fifty bandy-legged women served the king, each wearing necklaces crowned with gold. Musical entertainment was provided by female harpists, trumpeters, drummers, tabors, and castanet players, as only women were permitted to perform before the king. One such woman was Manisanda, daughter of the Ussa king, who was named Thirisandadevi and kept in a jewelled pyatthad. Her handmaids were three hundred daughters of ministers wearing livery crowned with ruby and hair styled in the su/i fashion, three hundred daughters of ministers wearing livery crowned with emerald and hair styled in the yakin-uyit fashion, and three hundred daughters of ministers wearing livery crowned with diamond and hair styled in the yakin-ucha fashion. Additionally, thirty humpbacked and thirty bandy-legged women wearing livery crowned with gold, along with female tabors, drummers, harpists, and trumpeters, provided daily musical performances for the queen.

In the historical account, Anawrahta is described as leading a vast army with an impressive number of animals, boats, and men. As he traveled across the country, he left stone figures and musical instruments to be played by his descendants. He also built many religious structures, including pagodas, gu, monasteries, and rest-houses. Additionally, Anawrahta was known for his engineering feats, such as constructing dams, channels, reservoirs, and canals throughout Burma. His most significant project was building four dams near the Panyaung river, which provided water to the fields for the next five thousand years.

Anuruddhadeva, a later king, built forty-three towns in order to prevent mixing with the Shan Yuns. The towns were designed to keep the Shan Yuns separate from the Burmese kingdom of Tampadipa and the Kamboja kingdom ruled by Maw kings of the Shan country of Maw. Anuruddhadeva also built fortified towns, the chief of which was Theinpya. Each town had a specific levy of soldiers assigned to it.

Kalaminyésishsin was appointed to build the forty-three towns, beginning with Kaungsin and ending with Taung-u, Kélin, Hswa, and Baranathi. While he was clearing the ground to build Haingtek, a tuskless elephant appeared from the north and passed eastward. Kalaminyésishsin began building the town that day and named it Haingtek after the elephant. However, Kalaminyésishsin later plotted against King Anawrahta and was punished, becoming a spirit after his death.

In 401 AD, after building the Pawrithat pagoda in Nyaungshwe Intein, King Anawrahta returned to find the mot-htaw zedi, built by King Dhammasoka, in ruins and covered with jungle, underwood, and thicket. The king rebuilt the zedi and renamed it Shweyin-myaw pagoda. He also built other pagodas, such as Payahla, Yinhla gu, Hkankyi gu, and Hpaya gu, and a spirit-house for the people to worship. He kept twenty headmen in twenty villages within the area. He built eleven villages, which included Pinle, Myitmans, Myittha, Myinhkontaing, Yamon, Panan, Mekhkara, Tabyettha, Thintaung, Tamoshso, and Hkanlu. He called the spirits of trees and the earth to witness when he finished all his dams, channels, reservoirs, and canals and planted a palmyra tree at the foot of Mt. Pyek, saying ‘When I become king once more in Pugarama, let the palmyra seed sprout!’ Later, when he became king, a small frog croaked under his lodge. Upon questioning his masters of white magic and black, he was told that the croaking indicated his ruin at the hands of an enemy, and he would enter the happiness of the world of spirits before entering Pugarama. He did not believe their prediction and locked them up in prison. However, he died when a wild buffalo called Cakkhupala charged and killed him. This was the result of the king's past deeds as the buffalo was an enemy in his previous life, and his evil karma gave the buffalo an opportunity to take revenge.
