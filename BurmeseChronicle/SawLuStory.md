## King Sawlu 

After the death of his father Anawrahtaminsaw, Sawlu, ascended to the throne. 

The early years of his reign were marked by a prophetic incident during his infancy, when he chose to eat an egg placed beneath the one traditionally presented to him during a feeding ceremony. This led wise men to predict the downfall of the royal line during his reign.

Sawlu's queens played an important role in his reign. Upon the death of his first queen, Uhsauppan, Sawlu gave her name and place to Thirisandadevi, daughter of the Ussa king.

The monarch's treatment of Kyanzittha, a close confidant, caused controversy. Advisers to Sawlu, including Shin Arahan and the heads of various villages and circles, urged the king to recall Kyanzittha from hiding and wandering. Upon his return, Kyanzittha gave a ring to Thambula, the niece of the mafti, and instructed her to sell it to nourish her child if it was a girl. If it was a boy, Thambula was to bring the child and the ring to him. However, Kyanzittha's provincial prosperity was forfeited when the concubines claimed he had spoken with Queen Hkin-u. Though Sawlu was initially angered and sent Kyanzittha back to Dala in the lower country, he was eventually persuaded to recall him and restore his old provincial prosperity. Throughout these events, Sawlu was attentive to the governance of villages and his kingdom.

### Nga Ramankun's Revolt

The Nga Ramankun's Revolt was a pivotal moment in the history of Myanmar. The uprising was sparked when King Sawlu of Myanmar, during a game of dice with his tutor's son, Nga Ramankan, challenged him to rebel against him with Pegu, a province that was under his control. Nga Ramankan accepted the challenge and began to gather a formidable force of soldiers, elephants, and horses in Pegu.

### Battle of Pyedawtha

As Nga Ramankan advanced towards Pugarama, he encamped at the island of Pyedawtha. King Sawlu, upon hearing of the advancing army, sent Kyanzittha with a large force of soldiers and an army of elephants and horses to confront him. The two sides met on the island, and Nga Ramankan, aware of Kyanzittha's skill in war, resorted to creating false arrays of elephants and horses using bamboo strips. These decoys were placed in swampy and muddy places, along with human figures holding shields of different shapes and sizes.

The battle commenced on the next day, but Nga Ramankan provoked the opposing forces to fight in the dim moonlight, where they could not observe their surroundings correctly. King Sawlu mistakenly believed a decoy elephant in the mud was real and charged at it, causing his royal elephant to get stuck in the mud. King Sawlu fled and took refuge in a hole in a banyan tree in the forest, while Thanmyinzwa, the royal elephant, was captured. The entire army was defeated, and Kyanzittha managed to escape to Pugarama.

Upon reaching Pugarama, Kyanzittha was hailed by the chief ministers and councillors, who offered him the five royal emblems and suggested he take the throne since there was no one to rule in King Sawlu's absence. However, Kyanzittha refused and stated that he would first ascertain the whereabouts of the king. He then placed the royal emblems in front of the Shwezigon and awaited further developments.

The Nga Ramankun'e Revolt was a significant turning point in Myanmar's history and marked the beginning of Nga Ramankan's reign. The revolt had far-reaching consequences and caused a shift in power that would ultimately shape the country's future.

### Capture of King Sawlu 

In the capture of Sawlu, Nga Ramankan, a determined leader, gathered his forces and diligently built a great army in order to seize Sawlu and Kyanzittha. In the midst of this, Sawlu, the captured king, had not eaten in three meals and was extremely hungry. He came across a soldier of Nga Ramankan gathering fuel who was eating rice, and in exchange for the soldier's rice, the king offered a priceless ring. The soldier, agreeing to keep silent, handed over his rice bundle to the king, who retreated to the safety of a hole in a banyan tree.

However, the soldier could not keep the matter to himself and showed the ring to his comrades. Eventually, Nga Ramankan found out about the ring and discovered that it belonged to Sawlu. Nga Ramankan then subjected the fuel-gatherer to torture until he admitted the truth, revealing Sawlu's whereabouts, and the king was captured and held captive.

Kyanzittha, who was fiercely loyal to Sawlu, decided to rescue him from captivity. He successfully stole Sawlu from his captors, but Sawlu feared for his life, thinking that Kyanzittha might kill him. Consequently, he cried out for help, and Kyanzittha abandoned him, leaving him to face his captors alone.

When Sawlu was recaptured, Kyanzittha fled, but the soldiers of Nga Ramankan quickly followed him and surrounded him. Kyanzittha was forced to swim westward, and the Mahagiri spirit created an island for him to rest upon when he became exhausted. The spirit then took the form of fishermen and transported Kyanzittha across the water to the bank at Aungtha, where he continued his journey north in search of the hunter Nga Sin.

### Kyanzittha Proves his Worth 

In the annals of history, the story of Kyanzittha, the future king of Myanmar, begins with his encounter with the headman of Ngahtihiaing, a village in the south. Upon arriving in Ngabtiblaing, Kyanzittha requested some cucumbers from the plantation of the Ngahtihiaing headman. The headman was known for his great strength and had a fence of thorns as high as an elephant surrounding his garden. To prove his worth, he challenged Kyanzittha to enter his garden by leaping over the fence, and Kyanzittha accepted the challenge with the help of his lance. Impressed by Kyanzittha's feat, the headman offered him his daughter and became his loyal servant. From that day on, Kyanzittha was known as Htihlaingshin.

Later, Kyanzittha set out to find the hunter Nga Sin, who had fled to Ngasinku upon hearing of Kyanzittha's pursuit. Kyanzittha searched for him in various places that are still known today, such as Sheinpaka, Shahkwe, and Ngasinkaing. After capturing Nga Sin, Kyanzittha mustered his forces and held court in eleven villages in the south, while Nga Htiblaing held court at Ngahtihlaing.

Kyanzittha's rise to power was foretold by a prophecy, and the Htihlaing monk Shin Poppa performed various magical rites to aid his cause. He recited charms over various materials and drew figures of the sun and moon on the frontlets of elephants, saddle pommels, shields, and standards of war, surrounding them with magic charms and sorceries. These objects were then piled in rows at Lédwin.

In the meantime, Nga Ramankan had found Sawlu, whom Kyanzittha had forsaken, and put him to death at Anuradha. Nga Ramankan then sought to rule in the city of Pugarama but was stopped by the ministers and headmen of villages who acknowledged Kyanzittha's rule over the eleven Lédwin villages. They refused to open the city gate until Kyanzittha had fought and conquered Nga Ramankan.

### Kyanzittha Defeats Nga Raman

The passage describes the defeat and death of Kyanzittha at the hands of Nga Raman. Nga Raman built a great army on water and land and advanced towards Kyanzittha, who performed magic rites before the battle. The battle was fierce, but Nga Raman's soldiers were terrified of Kyanzittha's strength, and they broke ranks and fled. Nga Raman himself fled on a golden raft of nine gems, pursued by Kyanzittha's men. He made a stand at Myinkaba but was forced to flee further down the country, pursued by Kyanzittha's hunter, Nga Sin. Nga Raman climbed a fig tree and sang like a bird to escape detection, but Nga Sin shot him in the eye, killing him. The place where Nga Raman died is still known as Ngasinku.

In contrast to Kyanzittha, King Sawlu lacked the ability to conceive or execute plans. He neglected to finish his father's construction of the Shwezigon, and his lack of concern for his advisors caused them great distress. He lived solely for pleasure and only ruled effectively for five years out of his 46-year reign. Smoke emerged from the Pahtodawgyi around the time of his death, and there was a celestial battle between the Thursday and Saturday stars. King Sawlu was born on a Wednesday.
