## King Kyanzittha

In 426 CE, Htihlaingshin Kyanzittha became the king and built a palace in a location deemed fair, with Anawrahtaminsaw’s palace to the east, the grave of a great bird that lived in the time of Pyuminhti to the north, and the moth-tar to the west. Upon ascending the throne, Kyanzittha worshipped the spirits. He had four queens: Apeyatana, Hkin-u, Hkintan, and Thambula. Apeyatana, the chief queen, gave birth to a daughter named Shwe-einthi, while queen Uhsauppan gave birth to a son. Kyanzittha loved his daughter Shwe-einthi and kept her in a palace with a single post. When the prince of Pateikkara heard of this, he came through the sky with a live gem in his mouth, bribed the Kyanthaing ministers who guarded her with ten baskets of silver, and became familiar with Shwe-einthi. Kyanzittha consulted with his ministers about whether to marry his daughter to the prince of Pateikkara or to Sawyun, his master's grandson. The ministers advised against the former, saying that it would turn the country into a Kala country. Despite this, Kyanzittha gave Shwe-einthi to Sawyun in marriage and made him heir.

Later, Shin Arahan met the prince of Pateikkara on his way to worship at Mahabodhi, and he told the prince that Shwe-einthi had been given in marriage to Sawyun. The prince, upon hearing this, opened his mouth, and the live gem slipped out, causing him to fall from the sky and perish. Some chronicles suggest that the prince came through the sky by means of a ruby-ring and, upon hearing the news of Shwe-einthi's marriage, starved himself to death, saying, "Let me die if I cannot get her whom I love!" Shin Arahan, who had been his fellow-worshipper in a former life, gathered and kept the bones of the prince of Pateikkara at the place called Wa.

In the year of 1112, the king Htilaingshin Kyanzittha ascended to the throne and constructed a palace in a location he deemed fair. The palace was situated near Anawrahtaminsaw's palace to the east, the grave of the great bird that lived during Pyuminhti's time to the north, and the moth-tar to the west. Upon ascending to the throne, the king worshipped the spirits and took several queens, including Apeyatana, Hkin-u, Hkintan, and Thambula. Apeyatana gave birth to a daughter named Shwe-einthi, whom the king cherished and kept in a palace with a single post.

One day, the prince of Pateikkara learned of Shwe-einthi and flew to her palace through the sky with a live gem in his mouth. He bribed the Kyanthaing ministers who guarded her with ten baskets of silver and became familiar with Shwe-einthi. The king later heard of this and consulted his ministers on whether to marry his daughter to the prince of Pateikkara or to Sawyun, his master's grandson. The ministers advised against the former option, stating that it would turn the country into a Kala country. Despite his ministers' advice, the king gave Shwe-einthi in marriage to Sawyun and made him heir.

Afterward, as Shin Arahan was on his way to worship at Mahabodhi, he met the prince of Pateikkara flying through the sky with the live gem in his mouth. Shin Arahan informed him that Shwe-einthi had been given in marriage to Sawyun, causing the prince to starve himself and die, saying, "Let me die if I cannot get her whom I love!" The prince's bones were gathered and kept by Shin Arahan at the place called Wa.

After the prince's death, Shwe-einthi's womb conceived, and she gave birth to a prince who cried loudly and continuously. When the king consulted his masters of white and black magic about the reason for his grandson's crying, they responded that the baby desired to know the boundaries of the kingdom. The king wrote the boundaries on a golden palmyra, and when they read it aloud in the baby's presence, he stopped crying. The king then took the baby in his bosom and ascended the throne, anointing him king with the title Thirizeyathura.

At the time of his anointing, the king's generals brought him Kyikala prisoners of war, stating that they had conquered the Kala country with Thandaung and Ngathonpinlé. The king made the Kalas live in quarters at Singu.

In the chronicles of ancient Myanmar, it is recorded that in a past life, the individuals who would become key figures in the country's history were linked by their common devotion to the pagoda. Htihlaingshin, who would one day be king, was joined by Thirizeyathu, his grandson and future monarch, Shin Arahan, a brahman, the Mahagiri spirit, who was the son of a wealthy man, and Thekminkaton, a general, in their prayers to the divine. Each made a specific plea: the prince wished to be a great king, the brahman a monk revered by royalty, the rich man's son a spirit worthy of worship, and the general a king who would help build a mighty empire. Htihlaingshin, who was king in this former life, prayed to be the leader of his four companions in whatever future incarnations they might have. These prayers were answered in their next lives, as Htihlaingshin became king, Thirizeyathu a prince, Shin Arahan a revered monk, the Mahagiri spirit a deity, and Thekminkaton a general.

In the course of his reign, King Htiblaingshin learned that Thekminkaton, his former comrade, was causing trouble on the border, and he dispatched a large force to apprehend him. However, Shin Arahan, now a Buddhist monk, appealed to the king's sense of loyalty, reminding him of the bond they shared in their past life. The monk implored the king not to sin against his friend, and it can be inferred that Thekminkaton was spared because of this appeal to their shared history.

In this historical account, it is reported that the future Htihlaingshin was a king in a past life, alongside his fellow-worshippers who included the future Thirizeyathu, the king's grandson, the future Shin Arahan, a brahman, the future Mahagiri spirit, a rich man's son, and the future Thekminkaton, a general. During their time worshipping at the pagoda, they each made a prayer about their future lives. As fate would have it, each of their prayers was answered and they each became the person they prayed to be in their next life.

One day, it was brought to the attention of Htihlaingshin that Thekminkaton was causing trouble in the border villages. Htihlaingshin then set out to capture Thekminkaton with a large group of fighting men and elephants, but Shin Arahan preached to the king and reminded him of their past life and that they had prayed together. The Mahagiri spirit also appeared and told the king how he had helped him in the past. As a result, the war was put to an end.

Additionally, Thambula, the niece of the mati, was warned by the king in the past that if she had a son, she should bring him to him along with a ring. When Thambula's son was seven years old, she brought him to the palace, but the king's minions attempted to drive her away. After much persistence, the king called her in and took her son to his bosom. He then appointed Thambula his queen with the title Uhsauppan, and gave her son the name of Zeyahkittara and made him the ruler of Dhafifiavati and the seven hill-tracts.

### Construction of Pagodas 

In the history of Myanmar, there were several notable pagodas built by the kings to express their faith and accumulate merits. One of the famous ones is Nagayon pagoda, built by King Htihlaingshin after a young Naga watched over him while he slept alone in a grazing-ground for horses. At the place called Apéyatana, he also built a gu and called it Apéyatana. Another pagoda, Shwezigon, was rebuilt and finished by King Htihlaingshin Kyanzittha, who took up the work left unfinished by his predecessors. He assembled all his soldiers throughout the kingdom and drew them up in two lines opposite each other from Shwezigon pagoda even to Mt. Tuywin to pass the rocks, and he planted tamarind seeds to give shelter to men. Sakra, disguised as a master mason, helped to hew and split the rocks and made the mortar set. Shwezigon pagoda was completed in seven months and seven days, and Sakra, who built the lion figure at the south-east corner and overlaid the pagoda with plaster, visited it every year. Another famous pagoda, Ananda, was built after King Htihlaingshin fed eight noble saints from Mt. Gandhamadana and called up the likeness of Nandamula grotto. The king made a great gu after the likeness of the grotto and named it Ananda. These pagodas are important religious and historical landmarks in Myanmar.

During the reign of Kyanzittha, a number of pagodas were constructed in various locations. After the completion of several meritorious works, Kyanzittha received nine sacred relics of the Lord's body from the king of Ceylon. In response, he built a pazo named Minochantha and a gu at the locations where the lance fell during his hiding in the north. Additionally, pagodas were built in Ngasinkaing, with one located at the foot of the mountain known as Hseippauk, and the other at the top known as Mingyaung.

A zigon was also constructed in Ava, named Htihlaingshin, and another was built in Pareimma, Kyanzittha's birthplace, where he played with his lance in the presence of the Mahagiri spirit. He constructed many pagodas, gu, monasteries, tazaung, resthouses, and ordination halls throughout the kingdom. Moreover, Kyanzittha dedicated five great bells cast in solid copper, each one thousand aduda in weight, with three at Shwezigon pagoda, one at Nanda pagoda, and one at Minochantha.

Kyanzittha passed away at the age of seventy-two, having amassed an impressive number of meritorious works during his forty-four years in the nether house and twenty-eight years of flourishing. At the time of his death, three ogres appeared on the top of the pyatthad, and the Tuesday star fought with the Saturday star, which is noteworthy as Kyanzittha was born on a Tuesday.
