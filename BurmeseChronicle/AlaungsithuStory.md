## King Alaungsithu

During the year 454, the grandson of King Htihlaingshin, Alaungsithu, ascended to the throne of the kingdom. His birth was surrounded by auspicious signs, as the great Einshin drum sounded by itself, and the throne-door opened without any assistance. His grandfather anointed and declared him king with the name Thirizeyathu, which means "I wait as an heir for my grandson’s palace, meet only for an Alaung!" Due to the sounds emanating from the drum, some chronicles refer to him as Alaungsithu. He is also known as Shwegudayaka, as he constructed the Shwegu pagoda soon after his ascension to the throne. Another title he received was Chettawshi, because his navel protruded about a span when he cried as an infant.

According to legend, Sakra bestowed upon him the grandiose title Siritari-bhavanadityapavarapanditasudhammarajamahadhipatinarapatisithu, at the foot of a rose-apple tree. He is also referred to as Narapatisithu in Thamaing and Mawgun, taking the final syllables from his original name given by Sakra. He is known as Alaungsithu in some chronicles due to the words spoken by the Shinbyu image when it fell into Balavamukkha and exclaimed "Alaungsithu, take me!"

Alaungsithu had four anointed queens: Yadanabon, Tilawkasanda, Razakommari, and Taungpyinthi. Yadanabon gave birth to Minshinsaw, while Tilawkasanda, who was later given the title Uhsauppan, gave birth to Htaukhlega. Razakommari had no children, and Taungpyinthi gave birth to two daughters, Taunghpya and Shwekyu. Additionally, Alaungsithu raised his sister-in-law to be queen with the name Hkin-u, who had four daughters with her late husbands. Sawnan, daughter of the first husband, was Rajathu's wife, Eindawthi, daughter of the second husband, was Kinkathu's wife, Sigon, daughter of the third husband, was Narathu's wife, and Kyaungdawthi, daughter of the youngest husband, passed away before marriage. When Alaungsithu raised Hkin-u to be queen, she gave birth to Chit-u and Kyaungdawthi. Alaungsithu also gifted his four daughters a sea-shell filled with gold dust, which they dissolved in sandalwood ointment and perfumes and used for self-anointment.

During the reign of King Alaungsithu, several significant events took place, as recorded in the chronicle of Shin Godhavara, who was the first to ascend Hngeppyittaung. One such event involved the king's brother-in-law, Mahathaman, who rode his elephant up to the palace and attempted to mount it on the stairway. However, the Mahagiri spirit, upon seeing him, threatened him, and he and his elephant were flung afar. This event was seen as a bad omen, and it was predicted that there would be many rebels in various parts of the country during the king's reign.

In the year 456, over one hundred thieves and cut-throats entered the palace, causing havoc and bloodshed. Despite the efforts of the people of the inner palace and the chamberlains, it was not until they came to the rescue and smote and thrust with spear and cutlass that peace was restored. Even then, the palace was not fit to behold due to the filth and bloodshed. The chronicle also reports that the ghosts of the dead thieves and cut-throats appeared afterward and affrighted the people at night, throwing dry dung, making water on them, and forcing the Tharaba gate.

King Alaungsithu had four teachers to instruct him, namely Shin Arahan, the elder son of Seinnyekmin, Shin Ananda, and the Mahagiri spirit. Additionally, the four queens of the king were each surrounded by a retinue of handmaids, consisting of 300 daughters of ministers wearing livery crowned with emerald, diamond, ruby, and pearl, with their hair done in various styles. There were also thirty hump-backed and bandy-legged women, four witty maids, daughters of rich men, and women-drummers, women-harpists, and women-trumpeters, who continually made music before the queens.

In the annals of King Alaungsithu's reign, it is recorded that his armies consisted of an impressive threescore thousand captains, thirty-two white elephants, eight hundred thousand black elephants, eight million horses, eight million boats, and one hundred and sixty million soldiers. His twelve royal boats, Thonlupuzaw, Thonlukyahngan, Pyigyinaung, Vazirathinhka, Aungthatago, Moaukkye, Swéle-yathit, Nawarat, Pyigyiwun, Tinyapyizon, Linzin, and Nagakye, were used to make a circuit of his kingdom with his armies.

The King, accompanied by his queens, concubines, and a host of ministers, embarked on a journey to the south and north of Burma. During his travels, he constructed reservoirs, canals, dams, and channels, and standardized the measure of the cubit and the fa, as well as the pé measure for marking off fields. The King established settlements and fortresses wherever food was available for his soldiers, elephants, and horses. He also aimed to ensure a uniform standard of weights and measures for all the colonies and forts throughout the country, by fixing the standard of weights and measures, such as the tical, two anna, and one anna weights, and measures of ¢in, Akwé, seit, sayut, pyi, hkwek, and sale.

King Alaungsithu's vision for his kingdom extended to the building of many ordination halls, pagodas, monasteries, and zigon, pakto, gu, &c. With a view to ensuring the longevity of the religion, he undertook the planting of outposts in areas where his country adjoined other countries. By these extensive and ambitious public works, King Alaungsithu sought to unite the different parts of his territory and ensure its prosperity, as well as provide for the benefit of all beings for the next five thousand years.

In this historical account, we learn about the travels and achievements of King Alaungsithu. It is reported that the king had an impressive military force consisting of 60,000 captains, 32 white elephants, 800,000 black elephants, 8 million horses, and 160 million soldiers. He also had 12 royal boats that were used to travel across the kingdom with his armies. The names of these boats were recorded as Thonlupuzaw, Thonlukya-hngan, Pyigyinaung, Vazirathinhka, Aungthatago, Moaukkye, Swéle-yathit, Nawarat, Pyigyiwun, Tinyapyizon, Linzin, and Nagakye.

King Alaungsithu was also involved in public works, such as making reservoirs, canals, dams, and channels. He fixed the measurement of the cubit and the fa, marked off fields with the pé measure, and settled soldiers and elephants wherever there was available food. He also built colonies and fortresses throughout his territory and standardized the weights and measures used in merchandise, including the tical, two anna, and one anna weights, as well as the measures of ¢in, Akwé, seit, sayut, pyi, hkwek, and sale. The king also built many ordination halls, pagodas, monasteries, and other religious structures with the aim of making the religion last for 5,000 years.

In addition, King Alaungsithu embarked on a journey to the coast with an image of the Lord cast in gold, his queen, and concubine, leaving guards to watch over the homeland Pugarama. He sailed on a ship surrounded by eight million boats and arrived at the end of Mt. Tangyi, where he saw an image of the Naga king made of glass that shone like the sun. The radiance of the glass was so bright that the king had to lift up his hand to shield his eyes. However, the radiance of his emerald ring given by Sakra quenched the radiance of the glass, and the king was able to see the image of the serpent king of the Nagas.

During his journey, the king also encountered stone images with five musical instruments slung about them. His masters of white magic and black informed him that they were left behind by his great-grandsire Anawrahtaminsaw, who said that when his sons and grandsons visited the place, they should strike the drums and harps and blow the trumpets. The king commanded them to strike and blow, and the stone images obeyed as if they were alive.

The journey of King Pagān to the coast was a grand expedition that featured numerous guards and an image of the Lord cast in gold that was of his own weight. Along with his queen and concubine, he traveled down the coast by both land and water. Upon entering the Kyelaung stream in the Talaing country, he built a royal refectory in Bassein and left his queen and concubine to stay there while he embarked on a ship, surrounded by eight million boats.

During his journey, he encountered an impressive sight at the end of Mt. Tangyi. On a rock-mat the size of a pé of land, an image of the Naga king made of glass shone brilliantly in the sun, appearing to human eyes like a sun-king. The king was wearing a ring of live emerald given to him by Sakra that quenched the radiance of the glass and allowed his ministers to see the image of the serpent king of the Nagas.

King Pagān also came across stone images with the five instruments of music slung about them that his deceased great-grandsire, Anawrahtaminsaw, had left behind him in his wanderings over the country. When he asked about the images, his masters of white magic and black explained that they were stone images that Anawrahtaminsaw had left behind, saying "When my sons and grandsons roam over the country and visit this place, strike ye the drums and harps and tambours, and blow ye the trumpets!" King Pagān then commanded them to strike and blow, and the stone images did so as if they were alive.

Later, the king visited the island of Ceylon, where the Ceylon king offered him his daughter Saw-uhtwe, along with a great thinkanek boat that held 800,000 men. The Ceylon king also offered the king an image ever worshipped by Ceylon kings in the likeness of Shin Mahakassapa practising ascetic attitudes.

King Pagān also traveled to the golden rose-apple tree and saw the rock-mat at its foot where the Buddhas sat. He longed to sit there but was advised by his masters of white magic and black not to. They warned him that the seat might belong to the Buddhas, so he should instead place his headdress there and make a solemn vow that it would be consumed like a fowl's feather cast upon a fire if it was the seat of the Buddhas. The king did as he was told, and his headdress was indeed consumed like cotton cast upon a fire. He stayed and held a great festival for seven months.

Sakra was pleased with King Pagān's actions and anointed him king, bestowing him with a title: Siritaribhavanadityapavarapandita-sudhammarajamahadhipatinarapatisithu. Sakra also gave him the Amyauk dram used by kings, small cymbals, and articles of royal pomp and splendor. Additionally, he created an image of the Lord from the rock-mat seat of the Buddhas shaped like the prow of the thetkatan, known as Shinbyu. He also offered King Pagān a dexter branch of the golden rose-apple tree and carved an image of the Lord out of the stump of the branch, called Shinhla.

### King Alaungsithu's journey

The following passage depicts the events that occurred during King Alaungsithu's journey. The king initially planned to visit Mount Meru, but was stopped by the god Sakra, who advised him to fulfill his religious duties before undertaking such a journey. As he sailed, his boat encountered the Balava-mukkha, causing it to shiver and almost break apart. However, the king made a vow, and all the spirits and ogres helped to save the boat, and a pair of ducks saved a sacred image of the Shinbyu. Next, the king went to Mallayu Island, where an ogress asked for his help in saving her son. The spirit Manimekhala rescued the boy and offered perfumes to the king. Then the king visited the rock of the white elephant and showed reverence. Later, the king of Manaung died before meeting King Alaungsithu because he was afraid of having to pay homage to him. When King Alaungsithu found out about this, he was deeply saddened and asked why his friend would rather die than pay homage to him. The king then cried out, and the earthen pot around the neck of the king of Manaung rose up as if he were alive.

During his travels, King Alaungsithu encountered various obstacles and demonstrated his religious piety and power to overcome them. These included his willingness to listen to divine counsel and fulfill his religious obligations before undertaking a journey to Mount Meru, as well as his vow and the help of spirits and ogres to save his boat from danger. The king also showed compassion towards an ogress and her son, and received offerings from the spirit Manimekhala. Additionally, he paid respect to sacred sites, such as the rock of the white elephant, and displayed sorrow upon learning of the death of the king of Manaung. Nevertheless, even in death, the king of Manaung was able to rise up as a result of King Alaungsithu's powerful cry, indicating his great influence and authority.

### Alaungsithu's encounter with a great scorpion

In this historical account, we learn of King Alaungsithu's encounter with a great scorpion in Jambudipa. The scorpion had made its nest from an elephant tusk and had killed and eaten an elephant. The king, intrigued by the elephant tusk, inquired about it from his masters of white and black magic, who explained that it was the nest of the great scorpion. The king took the tusks of the elephant and set them aboard his boat, which he used to escape the pursuing scorpion. Impressed by the king's actions, the scorpion lifted its head and tail as a sign of recognition and respect. In return, the king built a boat in the likeness of the scorpion.

Later, King Alaungsithu carved five images of the Lord from tharekhkan offered by Sakra and enshrined the six sacred relics offered by Sakra in the Myappaungmyizzu, a structure he fashioned with fragments of the tharekhkan, enclosing the dexter branch of the Wisdom Tree. He placed the images on a royal boat and set out to find a place for them to dwell for the benefit of all beings throughout the five thousand years of the religion. His search led him to Kunywa, where flocks of birds were flying in the sky, indicating that the place was the Mahanagararachinna country and the images of the Lord were fain to dwell there. The king set the images on five white elephants and built four pagodas – Kunywa, Pahkan, Shintaungma, and Hsingyo. He also gave one pagoda, Myappaungmyizzu, for worship to the noble masters filled with virtue and merit who practiced piety in Pahkangyi.

However, when the king attempted to set the Lord's image carved from the topmost part of the tharekhkan on a white elephant, it would not be lifted, nor would it follow. The wise explained that during his journey downcountry, a wild fowl dwelling in Thiha forest flew up to the raft and laid an egg, and there the image of the Lord was fain to practice piety. So the king went up again and built a sedi on the mid island in the parts of Thiha forest, where the image of the Lord practiced piety. From the hamaing of the five parts of the harekhhan, it would appear that the king built it during his journey downcountry.

King Alaungsithu did not stay long in his homeland as he frequently traveled across his kingdom, causing great distress to his cavalry, elephantry, and other parts of his army. During his absence, several regions experienced turmoil, including Bassein in the Talaing country, Nga Thit in Tetthit Island, Nga Hnwé in Mt. Hketthin, and Zeyyamingala on a commanding hill. The Kala appointed in Ceylon was corrupt in his allegiance, Tenasserim failed to bring tribute as usual, and Thekminkaton strayed from gratitude and truth.

To restore order, the king dispatched Generals Nga Yédaing and Nga Yénaing with a vast army of elephants and horses to confront Thekminkaton. Thekminkaton was defeated, and many prisoners of war were captured and brought back to a newly established village called Yahkaing. As the king held onto whatever he acquired, he made Yahkaing a home for the prisoners of war.

When Thekminkaton's head was severed and presented to the king, the Mahagiri spirit appeared and questioned the king's action. The king explained that he had punished Thekminkaton for disturbing the border villages and purlieux but had not desired his death. The Mahagiri spirit advised the king to worship Thekminkaton's head in a gem-embroidered casket with gold and silver chandeliers and flowers. However, when the king placed the head in front of him, it turned around, indicating its displeasure with the king's decision to execute it. To make amends, the king planted a wood-oil tree upside down and vowed that if it lived, he spoke the truth. The tree grew and thrived, allowing the king to bring Thekminkaton's head to Pugarama, where it received a proper burial on Mt. Tuywin, and people worshipped it annually.

To quell the rebellion in Tenasserim, the king led a campaign with his queen and concubine, sending numerous armies of elephants and horses to subdue the mutinous towns and villages. He did not relent until he had successfully conquered Tenasserim.

The passing of Shin Arakan marked a significant event in the history of the region. Upon returning home, Shin Arahan entered parinirvana, leaving a void that was eventually filled by the elder son of Seinnyekmin, who became the primate and was carried in a golden palanquin. King Alaungsithu, who was believed to have been the son of the Pateikkara king in a previous life, had a profound impact on the region. When he learned of the union between Shwe-einthi and Sawyun, he fell from the sky and died. Accompanied by his army, he retrieved the bones that Shin Arahan had collected and dropped them in the water at Nyaung-u shore. He then made a vow that if the bones were indeed his, they would float, which they did, and he treasured them in Shwegu pagoda.

King Alaungsithu also realized the benefit of setting the images of the Lord, Shinbyu, and Shinhla where the Lord was believed to dwell. He placed the images on a raft and traveled upcountry with 36 million fighting men by land and water. When they reached Pyatthadhla-amaw at Sagaing, the ogre Ngawek kicked the royal raft, causing the pyatthud tupika of the raft to fall, and the place was later known as Pyatthadhla. They then reached Gyaukma above Sagaing, where the Shinbyu image spoke and requested to abide in the chasm. King Alaungsithu then set the Lord's image on a white elephant and made a vow that it would kneel wherever it pleased to rest. The elephant entered Gyaukma and knelt on the riverbank, and the king built a gu for the two images Shinbyu and Shinhla, where they practiced piety. The king also made a vow that the image would ascend to a high place and kneel, which it did, and there he built a pagoda for the two images to be worshiped.

In the history of Arakan, Thinbkaya, the Wayaunghngessani, led a rebellion against Minbilu, who was the tenth in descent from Thekminkaton, and became king. Minyébaya, the son of Minbilu, and his wife Sawpauknyo sought refuge in Paukkarama, but their efforts to regain their ancestral home in Arakan were in vain. Eventually, Minyébaya fell ill and, before he died, he charged his son Lek-yaminnan to strive to return to their home and village. He instructed Lek-yaminnan to tie his hair in the Arakanese fashion during the king's head-washing ceremony to gain the king's attention and seek his support to regain their heritage.

Lek-yaminnan followed his father's instructions and caught the attention of the king during the ceremony. However, the king was initially angry and wanted to kill Lek-yaminnan, but he listened to his plea and appointed him as the commander-in-chief. The king then sent both the Burmese army under Theinpyissi by land and the Talaing army under Lek-yaminnan by water to defeat Minpati, the grandson of king Wayaunghngessani. The Talaings suffered a great loss, but Lek-yaminnan was eventually placed on the throne of Arakan with his sister Shwegutha.

According to the Yakhaing Minthami Egyin, Lek-yaminnan and Shwegutha ruled with great pomp and splendor, and they built a new city of Parein with the help of the Talaings and Pyus. Twinthinhmu Mahasithu claimed that Lek-yaminnan was put on the throne during the reign of the king's grandson Narapatisithu, but this conflicts with the line of kings recorded in the Arakan Chronicle, which shows that the reign of king Alaungsithu lasted beyond the year 480. Therefore, the word of Twinthinhmu should not be accepted without further evidence.

In this historical account, it is recounted that King Alaungsithu undertook a journey to the Tarop country to request the sacred tooth. Upon arrival, he was greeted by the Utibwa, ruler of the great Tarop kingdom of Gandhala, who offered him a variety of gifts and presents. The two kings engaged in a gracious conversation, during which the Utibwa inquired about the purpose of King Alaungsithu's visit. The latter replied that he had not come seeking worldly prosperity but rather to entreat the holy tooth in order to attain transcendent happiness.

The Utibwa, moved by King Alaungsithu's sincerity, offered him the holy tooth, declaring that if it was willing to practice piety with him, he could take it. King Alaungsithu then presented various offerings, including gold and silver chandeliers, flowers, and balls of parched rice, and worshipped at the pyatthad where the holy tooth resided. Miraculously, the tooth adorned itself with the thirty-two greater and eighty lesser signs and six rays, shouldered the eight things needful, and ascended to the sky, moving back and forth.

Despite King Alaungsithu's fervent pleading, the holy tooth did not descend from the sky. The Utibwa then reminded him that his great-grandfather, Anawrahtaminsaw, had also entreated the holy tooth, but it had refused to practice piety with him. The Utibwa explained that it was prophesized that the holy tooth would remain in the kingdom of Gandhala for the full five thousand years of the religion, and therefore it would not practice piety with King Alaungsithu.

The king was greatly distressed by this news, but the Utibwa consoled him with additional gifts and presents. The encounter between King Alaungsithu and the Utibwa of Gandhala thus provides an example of the religious and political exchanges that occurred during this historical period.

Alaungsithu, a Burmese king, constructed several pagodas in his reign, demonstrating his religious devotion and desire to accumulate merit. He acknowledged the absence of a holy object to worship and built nine mot-htaw in the north upon his return to Pugarama. Alaungsithu continued to build other pagodas, including Thabbyinnyu pagoda in Paukkarama, which featured two large copper bells weighing ten thousand aduda, significantly larger and nobler than those offered by his grandfather.

The king's prideful behavior and the loss of his physical strength became a subject of ridicule among his ministers. To prove his strength, the king boasted of his ability to catch a notorious thief who was terrorizing the region. He dispatched four generals to capture the thief, but they were unable to apprehend him, and the king took matters into his own hands.

Alaungsithu disguised himself as the thief, wore a striped headdress, and rode a striped horse. He led the four generals on a wild chase, riding towards and away from them multiple times, until they became frightened and believed him to be a spirit or devil. The king eventually returned to his city and revealed his true identity, proving his physical prowess and earning the respect and fear of his ministers.

King Alaungsithu's elephant hunting was a prominent aspect of his reign, which was characterized by power and glory. As an expert in the knowledge of elephants, horses, and archery, he engaged in hunting expeditions with his ministers in various forests, including Mahton, Pantaung, and Talop. These hunts were highly successful, with Alaungsithu capturing over a thousand elephants, including young she-elephants and male elephants. He even climbed the tusk of a royal elephant in Talop forest and used a noose made of Thintwé rope to catch over seven hundred young she-elephants. These hunting expeditions became a significant part of Alaungsithu's legacy, and he frequently engaged in them throughout his kingdom.

Another significant event in Alaungsithu's reign was his discovery of rubies at the foot of Mt. Mali. Upon receiving reports of the jewel's discovery, the king traveled by water and land to the location and collected a large number of rubies. He filled a boat, which was six cubits in beam, with the precious stones, and enshrined them in Shwegu and Thabbyinnyu pagodas, where they were worshipped. This act became an essential part of Alaungsithu's reign and contributed to the economic and cultural development of his kingdom.

King Alaungsithu was a ruler of great glory, dominion, and power, who had a vast knowledge of elephants, horses, and archery. He enjoyed hunting elephants with his ministers in various forests across his kingdom. His successful hunts led him to catch over a thousand unblemished elephants, with some having one tusk, others none, and some with straight or bent tusks, along with young she-elephants. He also caught over seven hundred young she-elephants in the Pantaung forest, and over one hundred young male elephants in the Ngahsaunggyan forest. He proudly boasted of his achievements, considering himself greater than his ancestors, and sinned in thought and speech. As punishment, he lost his eyesight. Seeking counsel, he was advised to worship the images of his royal ancestors with gold and silver chandeliers, garlands, and balls of parched rice. He cast images of the forty-four generations of kings in gold and worshipped them, and his eyesight was restored.

King Alaungsithu was also known for his love of song and the sound of harp and horn. He was wealthy and had vast treasures, including goodly elephants and horses. His clerks and scriveners had to indite and copy documents in his leaden halls and treasuries daily. He was interested in history and had images of his great-grandfather, grandfather, father, and other important figures in his kingdom cast in pure copper. He kept them all with inscriptions inside the Shwegu pagoda. He also noted down the number of his young white and black she-elephants, the number of his boats, and soldiers, aldermen, and scriveners on the inscription within the Shwegu. Overall, King Alaungsithu was a magnificent ruler with vast knowledge and wealth, who enjoyed hunting and valued his heritage.

In the chronicles of the great Burmese king Alaungsithu, there are accounts of his marriages and familial relationships, as well as instances of court intrigue. One such event involved the daughter of the king of Pateikkara, whom Alaungsithu married and named Pabhavati. She served him diligently, but when his three sons came to pay homage to their father, Pabhavati remained at the king's side on the royal couch. Minshinsaw, the eldest son, took offense at her presence and refused to pay homage, claiming that it was inappropriate for a "Kala wench" to be present. This incident illustrates the complex social dynamics at play in the court of Alaungsithu.

In another episode, Alaungsithu showed kindness to Anantathuriya, the son of his royal usher, by giving him a robe normally reserved for princes. However, when Minshinsaw saw Anantathuriya wearing the robe at a council meeting, he stripped him of it and gave him a more appropriate garment, asserting that only the king's brother or son was worthy of wearing such a robe. These incidents reveal the tension and conflict that could arise between family members and court officials in the royal court of Burma during the reign of Alaungsithu.

### Alaungsithu & his Sons 

In this historical account, we learn about the tumultuous relationship between King Alaungsithu and his sons Minshinsaw and Narathu. When the king offered his daughter Pabhavati to the king of Pateikkara, he showed great compassion by giving her an entourage of handmaids and attendants. However, when the king's three sons came to pay their respects, Minshinsaw was insulted by the presence of Pabhavati on the royal couch and refused to pay homage to his father.

Furthermore, Minshinsaw also caused controversy when he stripped Anantathuriya, son of the royal usher, of a robe given to him by the king, and gave him a lower-ranking garment. The king, fearing for the future of his family and advisors, stripped Minshinsaw of his provincial revenues, bodyguard, estates, gold, and silver, and cast him into prison. Only after the pleading of his mother and ministers did the king take pity on Minshinsaw and restore some of his wealth and estates, but ultimately banished him from the city.

In his exile, Minshinsaw established a prosperous village and domain, damming lakes and building canals to cultivate thirty thousand pé of land and produce three crops a year. He also invited scholars of the noble Order to teach and write many books, while supporting them with necessary resources. Meanwhile, King Alaungsithu appointed his middle son Narathu to govern the affairs of the kingdom, whose mother was the daughter of the minister to Htihlaingshin Kyanzittha. The king elevated her to the rank of maid of honour, less than a queen but more than a concubine.
