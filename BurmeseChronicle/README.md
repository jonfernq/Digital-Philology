## The Burmese Chronicle

The royal chronicles of Myanmar (Burmese: မြန်မာ ရာဇဝင် ကျမ်းများ) also known as [Burmese chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_chronicles) are detailed and continuous chronicles of the monarchy of Myanmar (Burma). 

The most complete extant chronicles are those of Upper Burma-based dynasties. The first standard national chronicle dates from the 1720s.

Chronicles are of the Pali-Sanskrit 'vamsa' literary genre, chronicling the royal dynastic lineages of kings.

Chronicles focus largely on royal efforts directed towards consolidating and extending power geographically, particularly through military means, as well as supporting the Buddhist religion through religioous donations, the support of monks and monastic institions, and the construction of temples and pagodas.

**Anawrahtaminsaw အနော်ရထာ မင်းစော** 11 May 1014 – 11 April 1077 (1017-1059) - 
"In December 1044, a Pagan prince named Anawrahta came to power.  
Over the next three decades, he turned this small principality into the First Burmese Empire — 
the "charter polity" that formed the basis of modern-day Burma/Myanmar.
Historically verifiable Burmese history begins with his accession" (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan_Kingdom#Pagan_Empire))

The Wikipedia article on [Anawrahta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anawrahta) provides a good historical overview and bibliography noting that, "his life stories (legends) are a staple of Burmese folklore and retold in popular literature and theater." These stories as well as records of religious donations and military campaigns provide much of the content of the Burmese Chronicle, providing a semi-fictional historical narrative summarized here:
