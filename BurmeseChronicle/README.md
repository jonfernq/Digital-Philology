## The Burmese Chronicle

The royal chronicles of Myanmar (Burmese: မြန်မာ ရာဇဝင် ကျမ်းများ) also known as [Burmese chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_chronicles) are detailed and continuous chronicles of the monarchy of Myanmar (Burma). 

The most complete extant chronicles are those of Upper Burma-based dynasties. The first standard national chronicle dates from the 1720s.

Chronicles are of the Pali-Sanskrit 'vamsa' literary genre, chronicling the royal dynastic lineages of kings.

Chronicles focus largely on royal efforts directed towards consolidating and extending power geographically, particularly through military means, as well as supporting the Buddhist religion through religioous donations, the support of monks and monastic institions, and the construction of temples and pagodas. 

### Kings of Pagan

**Anawrahtaminsaw အနော်ရထာ မင်းစော** 11 May 1014 – 11 April 1077 (1017-1059) - 
"In December 1044, a Pagan prince named Anawrahta came to power. Over the next three decades, he turned this small principality 
into the First Burmese Empire — the "charter polity" that formed the basis of modern-day Burma/Myanmar.
Historically verifiable Burmese history begins with his accession" (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan_Kingdom#Pagan_Empire))

Perhaps because it is largely derived from Pali and Indian traditions of historiography, Burmese historical narratives have typically been embellished with stories.
Official histories of China such as the Annals of the Ming Dynasty (Ming Shi Lu) because they are directly derived from archival records, 
at least have a more factual flavor.

I note this only because the western discipline of history since the time of [Ranke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke) has emphasized historical veracity, 'factual' history, and the reconstruction of the event 'wie es eigentlich gewesen ist' ("as it actually happened") from [primary sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source). Due to the extensive story-telling to be found in chronicle historical narratives, Burmese chronicles have been likened to 'fairy tales' by western historians and observers (e.g. Aldous Huxley in 'Justing Pilate'), and efforts have been directed to de-mythologize it with the use of inscriptions and external foreign sources. However, with these efforts to de-mythologize, the original literary sources have been neglected. These sources, though consisting of a mixture of fact and fiction can be reckoned as an integral part of cultural and intellectual history, not always dateable to a specific point in time, and likely the accumulation of succesive interpretations and re-interpretations over time.   

The Wikipedia article on [Anawrahta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anawrahta) provides a good overview of factual history and bibliography noting that, "his life stories (legends) are a staple of Burmese folklore and retold in popular literature and theater." These stories as well as records of religious donations and military campaigns provide much of the content of the Burmese Chronicle, providing a semi-fictional historical narrative summarized here:
