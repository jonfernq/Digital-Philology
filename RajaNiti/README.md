## Raja Niti

Raja Niti are lists of aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature. 
  
[Nitisastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_in_religion#Hindu_ethics) (Sanskrit: नीतिशास्त्र), the science of niti, can be characterized as the science of ethics.  

The foremost work of Nitisastra is the [Kāmandakīya Nītisāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitisara) or Nitisara of Kamandaki,
available most recently in the masterful English interpretive translation of University of Hawaii Sanskrit professor Jesse Knutson,
in the [Murty Classical Library of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murty_Classical_Library_of_India).
                    
In Sanskrit literature 'niti' are a form of subhashita: 

"A subhashita (Sanskrit: सुभाषित, subhāṣita) is a literary genre of Sanskrit epigrammatic poems 
and their message is an aphorism, maxim, advice, fact, truth, lesson or riddle.[1] 
Su in Sanskrit means good; bhashita means spoken; which together literally means well spoken or eloquent saying."
(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita)) 
     
[Ludwik_Sternbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwik_Sternbach)(1909-1981) was the foremost scholar of subhashita, 
who traced the path of this aphoristic wisdom through Indian and Southeast Asian literary works,
as well as more far-flung literatures. Some of his works consist of huge cross-reference indices,
in some respects foreseeing the work of contemporary computational corpus linguistics 
in drawing connections between different literary works and genres. 

# Southeast Asian Aphoristic Literature

The Niti aphoristic literature is common in Southeast Asian Theravadan Buddhist countries and is categorized into three branches:
Loka Niti, Dhamma Niti, and Raja Niti. They have been available in English translation for quite a while:
