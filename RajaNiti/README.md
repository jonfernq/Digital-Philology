## Raja Niti

Raja Niti are aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature. 
  
In Sanskrit literature 'niti' are known as subhashita: 

"A subhashita (Sanskrit: सुभाषित, subhāṣita) is a literary genre of Sanskrit epigrammatic poems 
and their message is an aphorism, maxim, advice, fact, truth, lesson or riddle.[1] 
Su in Sanskrit means good; bhashita means spoken; which together literally means well spoken or eloquent saying."

[Ludwik_Sternbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwik_Sternbach)(1909-1981) was he foremost scholar of subhashita, 
who traced the path of this aphoristic wisdom through Indian and Southeast Asian literary works,
as well as more far-flung literatures. Some of his works consist of huge cross-reference indices,
in some respects foreseeing the work of contemporary computational corpus linguistics 
in drawing connections between different literary works and genres. 

# Southeast Asian Aphoristic Literature

In Southeast Asian Theravadan Buddhist countries aphorisms are categorized into three branches:
Loka Niti, Dhamma Niti, and Raja Niti. They have been available in English translation for quite a while:

The German Indologist [Heinz Bechert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Bechert)(1932 – 2005) [[German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Bechert)] published a monograph with the original Pali:
