## Raja Niti

Raja Niti are lists of aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature. 
  
[Nitisastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_in_religion#Hindu_ethics) (Sanskrit: नीतिशास्त्र), the science of niti, can be characterized as the science of ethics.  

The foremost work of Nitisastra is the [*Kāmandakīya Nītisāra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitisara) or Nitisara of Kamandaki,
available most recently in the masterful English translation of University of Hawaii Sanskrit professor Jesse Knutson,
in the [Murty Classical Library of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murty_Classical_Library_of_India).
                    
In Sanskrit literature 'niti' are a form of subhashita: 

> "A subhashita (Sanskrit: सुभाषित, subhāṣita) is a literary genre of Sanskrit epigrammatic poems 
> and their message is an aphorism, maxim, advice, fact, truth, lesson or riddle. 
> Su in Sanskrit means good; bhashita means spoken; which together literally means well spoken or eloquent saying."
> (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita)) 
     
[Ludwik_Sternbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwik_Sternbach) (1909-1981) was the foremost scholar of *subhashita*, 
who traced the path of this aphoristic wisdom through Indian and Southeast Asian literary works,
as well as more far-flung literatures. Some of his works consist of huge cross-reference indices,
in some respects foreseeing the work of contemporary computational corpus linguistics 
in drawing connections between different literary works and genres. 

My work traces the inclusion and influence of Raja Niti in the historical chronicle of Burma known as the [U Kala Maha Yazawindawgyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maha_Yazawin) (Burmese: မဟာ ရာဇဝင်တော်ကြီး):

### Southeast Asian Aphoristic Literature

The Niti aphoristic literature is common in Southeast Asian Theravadan Buddhist countries and is categorized into three branches:
Loka Niti, Dhamma Niti, and Raja Niti. It is worth noting that the Thai word 'niti' (นิติ) means 'law', however 'rajaniti' (ราชานิติ) is a genre of Pali-derived literature, as discussed in [this Thai article](http://www.library.polsci.chula.ac.th/dl/d29dc078c6d2c092d603ad2b2a3ae59d). The [โคลงโลกนิติ](https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4) or 'Lokaniti poem' (1831) is a well-known Thai poem based on the corresponding aphoristic literature. 

Niti aphorisms have been available in English translation for quite a while (providing the English translation used below):

A gardener should carefully plant a twig that has been thrown away ; he should break off the flowers in bloom, allow the small plants to develop, cause very erect ones  to bend, those too much inclined to be made more erect; he should remove the bark from trees that are too green; a tree being small, he should plant thorny shrubs on the outside ; he should cherish lovingly one that is in a thriving condition : a king, the cherisher of a kingdom, should take delight in his realm, just as a good gardener takes delight in a garden.
