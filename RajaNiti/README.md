## Raja Niti

Raja Niti are lists of aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature. 
  
[Nitisastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_in_religion#Hindu_ethics) (Sanskrit: नीतिशास्त्र), the science of niti, can be characterized as the science of ethics.  

The foremost work of Nitisastra is the [Kāmandakīya Nītisāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitisara) or Nitisara of Kamandaki,
available most recently in the masterful English interpretive translation of University of Hawaii Sanskrit professor Jesse Knutson,
in the [Murty Classical Library of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murty_Classical_Library_of_India).
                    
In Sanskrit literature 'niti' are a form of subhashita: 

> "A subhashita (Sanskrit: सुभाषित, subhāṣita) is a literary genre of Sanskrit epigrammatic poems 
> and their message is an aphorism, maxim, advice, fact, truth, lesson or riddle.[1] 
> Su in Sanskrit means good; bhashita means spoken; which together literally means well spoken or eloquent saying."
> (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita)) 
     
[Ludwik_Sternbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwik_Sternbach) (1909-1981) was the foremost scholar of subhashita, 
who traced the path of this aphoristic wisdom through Indian and Southeast Asian literary works,
as well as more far-flung literatures. Some of his works consist of huge cross-reference indices,
in some respects foreseeing the work of contemporary computational corpus linguistics 
in drawing connections between different literary works and genres. 

My work traces the inclusion and influence of Raja Niti in the historical chronicle of Burma known as the [U Kala Maha Yazawindawgyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maha_Yazawin) (Burmese: မဟာ ရာဇဝင်တော်ကြီး):

### Southeast Asian Aphoristic Literature

The Niti aphoristic literature is common in Southeast Asian Theravadan Buddhist countries and is categorized into three branches:
Loka Niti, Dhamma Niti, and Raja Niti. They have been available in English translation for quite a while (providing the English translation used below):

> (See Archive.org [original](https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.110810) & [later](https://archive.org/details/ancientproverbs00graygoog))

The German Indologist [Heinz Bechert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Bechert) (1932 – 2005) [[in German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Bechert)] published a monograph with the original Pali (providing the Pali used below):

3. A man is known to be wise by his speech — his conduct, good or bad, by the company he keeps; by his general behaviour he is known to be pure; in time of danger, whether he is a man or not.
