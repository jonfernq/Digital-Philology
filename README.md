## History: Tai, Mon, Burmese

First, we have the original primary source materials for mainland Southeast Asian history, consisting basically of [chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_chronicles) and [inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Inscriptions_of_Myanmar). These genres of source material are composed according to their own sets of conventions and provide limited circumscribed sets of information from which inferences are often made about wider aspects of society. 

There are other types of sources, external sources that can be juxtaposed with primary sources to critically assess their veracity and relevanc such as Ming dynasty court annals ([Ming Shilu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Shilu)) or travels narratives of Portuguese mercenary adventurers such as [Fernão Mendes Pinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern%C3%A3o_Mendes_Pinto). 

There has been very little in the way of publishing well-edited translations of the primary source chronicles and inscriptions, and this does not seem likely to change in the near future. Those shining examples that do exist, such as Geoffrey Wade's translations from the Ming Shilu for Southeast Asia, or Pat Pranke's translaton of the Vamsadipani chronicle of monastic institutions in Burma, have not gained their due of recognition with the scholarly community and academia. 

We are entering a new era of automated machine translation as [large-scale language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models) make headway in [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation), so it is only natural to start thinking about how to best harness this technology towards scholarly translation, and translating the long-untranslated primary source material for Southeast Asian history.  

Second, the use of primary source material to write insightful and engaging historical narratives and monographs is also not very well-developed. Part of this lack of development is precisely because the original primary sources upon which this sort of 'scholarly monograph' work is based are not available for adequate assessment of the historical interpretations made in these monographs and narratives. One almost has to be already steeped in the hard to access indigenous sources written in indigenous classical languages to adequately assess such scholarly monographs, skills that few can claim to possess. (Note: The under-appreciated historian of pre-modern Cambodia [Michael Vickery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vickery) fits the bill perfectly.)

[Transnational histories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnational_history) (or trans-polity trans-political unit in the premodern context) that take a broader focus, weaving together the histories of different geographical regions, also lags in development (though definitely given impetus by [Victor B. Lieberman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lieberman) *Strange Parallels* (2003, 2009)).

So, there are many undeveloped facets of mainland Southeast Asian history that remain to be further developed. The methodological aim here is to employ 'digital philology', meaning computational methods applied to the critical and elucidating translation and study of indigenous historical and literary texts.

### Raja Niti

- [Raja Niti](https://github.com/jonfernq/Digital-Philology/tree/main/RajaNiti): Raja Niti are lists of aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature widespread and influential in the literatures of Theravadan Buddhist countries such as Thailand and Burma. 

### Theory 

Essential theory texts for conceptualizing the historical mode of production of mainland Southeast Asian political formations c. 1300-1600. 

- [A Paradigm for the Study of War and Society](https://www.academia.edu/3112540/A_Paradigm_for_the_Study_of_War_and_Society) by Brian Ferguson: Paraphrased [here](https://github.com/jonfernq/Digital-Philology/blob/main/Theory/ParadigmsOfWarAndSociety.md) to isolate the essential ideas and as a step towards applying the ideas to Burmese history.  

- [How Chiefs Come to Power](https://www.scribd.com/document/434097760/Earle-Timothy-How-Chiefs-Come-to-Power#) by Timothy Earle: A study of the political 'power' of chiefs with respect to the political formation of the 'chieftainship' is nicely summarized in a diagram:

- *Warless Societies and the Origin of War* by [Raymond C. Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_C._Kelly): "...employs a comparative ethnographic analysis of warless and warlike hunting and gathering societies to isolate distinctive features of peaceful preagricultural people and to develop a theoretical model of the origin of war and the early coevolution of war and society," particularly insightful in exploring the nexus between law and warfare contrasting the sanction of the punishment of death for a crime of murder with tit-for-tat feud which targets the whole family of the perpetrator to revenge the killing.

### Historical Timelines

### Vamsa, Royal Genealogies and Periodization

Historical works in India, Burma, Sri Lanka and other Theravadan Buddhist countries are written in the form of a [Vaṃśa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va%E1%B9%83sa) (lineage, genealogy) (Sanskrit: वंशम्).

In the political sphere, this is a royal lineage of kings or local princes (lineage of a dynasty). 

The  reigns of individual kings within a dynasty punctuated by occasional inter-regna, provide a periodization of history into meaningful dynastic units of time. 

In contrast, in the religious sphere a Vaṃśa can be a lineage of monks and teachers. 'Theravadan Buddhism' is defined by ordination lineages (a point I heard scholar of Buddhism Peter Skilling make repeatedly).  

Here are some dynastically organized lists of Burmese kings:

### Tracking Wikipedia Coverage of History

In many countries nowadays, people are more likely to get the history of their country from Wikipedia, rather than the expensive, published, library-bound scholarly monographs that provide the most accurate information and historical analysis. 

For Burmese history there are significant gaps in historical coverage, some of which are listed on my [personal Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jon_Fernquest_2022). 

Computational strategies for dealing with this issue will be dealt with here. First, for some important missing pieces of historical information:
