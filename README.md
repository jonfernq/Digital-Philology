## Digital-Philology

Computational methods applied to the critical study of historical and literary texts.

### Raja Niti

- [Raja Niti](https://github.com/jonfernq/Digital-Philology/tree/main/RajaNiti): Raja Niti are lists of aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature widespread and influential in the literatures of Theravadan Buddhist countries such as Thailand and Burma. 

### Historical Timelines

- [Rajadhirat Periodization Tree](https://github.com/jonfernq/Digital-Philology/tree/main/HistoricalTimelines): A historical timeline can be stored in a tree-like database.

### Vamsa, Royal Genealogies and Periodization

Historical works in India, Burma, Sri Lanka and other Theravadan Buddhist countries are written in the form of a [Vaṃśa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va%E1%B9%83sa) (lineage, genealogy) (Sanskrit: वंशम्, IAST: Vaṃśam).

In the political sphere, this is a royal lineage of kings or local princes (lineage of a dynasty). 

The  reigns of individual kings within a dynasty punctuated by occasional inter-regnum, provide a periodization of history into meaningful units of time. 

In the religious sphere, this can be a lineage of monks and teachers. 'Theravadan Buddhism' is defined by an ordination lineage.

### Tracking Wikipedia Coverage of History

In many countries nowadays, people are more likely to get the history of their country from Wikipedia, rather than the expensive, published, library-bound scholarly monographs that provide the most accurate information and historical analysis. 

For Burmese history there are significant gaps in historical coverage, some of which are listed on my [personal Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jon_Fernquest_2022). 

Computational strategies for dealing with this issue will be dealt with here. First, for some important missing pieces of historical information:
