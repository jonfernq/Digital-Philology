## History: Tai, Mon, Burmese

First, we have the original primary source materials for mainland Southeast Asian history, consisting basically of chronicles and inscriptions. This genre of source material is composed according to its own set of conventions and provides a limited circumscribed set of information from which inferences are often made. 

There are other types of sources, external sources that can be juxtaposed with primary sources to critically assess their veracity and relevanc such as Ming dynasty court annals ([Ming Shilu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Shilu)) or travels narratives of Portuguese mercenary adventurers such as [Fernão Mendes Pinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern%C3%A3o_Mendes_Pinto). 

There has been very little in the way of publishing well-edited translations of the primary source chronicles and inscriptions, and this does not seem likely to change in the near future. Thus, that is one goal here, but we are entering a new era of automated translation as large-scale models make headway in machine translation. It is only natural to harness this technology towards translating long-untranslated primary source material for Southeast Asian history.  

Second, the use of primary sources to write insightful and engaging historical narratives and monographs is also not very well-developed. 

[Transnational histories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnational_history) (or trans-polity trans-political unit in the premodern context) that take a broader focus, weaving together the histories of different geographical regions, also lags in development (though definitely given impetus by [Victor B. Lieberman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lieberman) *Strange Parallels* (2003, 2009)).

So, there are many undeveloped facets of mainland Southeast Asian history that remain to be further developed. The methodological aim here is to employ 'digital philology', meaning computational methods applied to the critical study of historical and literary texts.

### Raja Niti

- [Raja Niti](https://github.com/jonfernq/Digital-Philology/tree/main/RajaNiti): Raja Niti are lists of aphorisms on kingship derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit and Pali literature widespread and influential in the literatures of Theravadan Buddhist countries such as Thailand and Burma. 

### Historical Timelines

- [Rajadhirat Periodization Tree](https://github.com/jonfernq/Digital-Philology/tree/main/HistoricalTimelines): A historical timeline can be stored in a tree-like database.

### Vamsa, Royal Genealogies and Periodization

Historical works in India, Burma, Sri Lanka and other Theravadan Buddhist countries are written in the form of a [Vaṃśa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va%E1%B9%83sa) (lineage, genealogy) (Sanskrit: वंशम्).

In the political sphere, this is a royal lineage of kings or local princes (lineage of a dynasty). 

The  reigns of individual kings within a dynasty punctuated by occasional inter-regna, provide a periodization of history into meaningful dynastic units of time. 

In contrast, in the religious sphere a Vaṃśa can be a lineage of monks and teachers. 'Theravadan Buddhism' is defined by ordination lineages (a point I heard scholar of Buddhism Peter Skilling make repeatedly).  

Here are some dynastically organized lists of Burmese kings:

### Tracking Wikipedia Coverage of History

In many countries nowadays, people are more likely to get the history of their country from Wikipedia, rather than the expensive, published, library-bound scholarly monographs that provide the most accurate information and historical analysis. 

For Burmese history there are significant gaps in historical coverage, some of which are listed on my [personal Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jon_Fernquest_2022). 

Computational strategies for dealing with this issue will be dealt with here. First, for some important missing pieces of historical information:
