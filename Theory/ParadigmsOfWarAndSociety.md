## Paradigms of Warfare and Society 

Paraphrased from the work of Brian Ferguson. 

### Introduction 

The study of war often focuses on campaign and combat, neglecting the cultural connections of war. Anthropology, on the other hand, places emphasis on the sociocultural systems surrounding war. This discipline is particularly relevant to understanding war due to its holistic and cross-cultural comparative approach. In smaller, less complex societies studied by anthropologists, the patterns of integration are clear and can be compared to one another. However, due to the scale of the societies examined in this volume, it is difficult to achieve holistic synthesis and comparison. Therefore, this chapter applies a holistic model of the sociocultural ramifications of war that has been developed through the cross-cultural study of stateless peoples, to the cases presented in this volume.

The model categorizes sociocultural phenomena into infrastructure, structure, and superstructure, which are conceptualized together as a complex hierarchy of progressively more limiting constraints. Infrastructure involves variables that affect a people's physical existence and relation to nature, such as interaction with the physical environment, population characteristics, and technology. Structure consists of organized social life, patterns of interpersonal connections and divisions sorted into social organization, economics, and politics. Superstructure includes the mental constructs of culture, its belief systems, and patterned emotional dispositions.

The model provides a common framework usable for cross-cultural comparison or for investigating war-society connections in one case. It combines different approaches to deal with different topical questions, causes and effects of war, different time frames and levels of analysis, and both system and process. This paradigm has previously been derived almost entirely from research into non-state societies, with simple states as the end point in the range. This chapter is a test of the paradigm's applicability to war and society in the ancient and medieval world. It aims to determine whether it applies to the case material presented in this volume and whether it helps make sense of the bewildering rush of histories that have preceded.

The current paradigm presented in this essay differs from earlier discussions, which focused on the relationships between war and society, with some consideration given to intersocietal interactions. The current approach takes a holistic perspective on war and distinguishes between the explicit relations between war and sociocultural systems within polities (war-making units) and those that occur among polities. This approach opens up new areas for investigation and is applicable to international relations approaches, while drawing attention to the internal-external dialectics that frequently dominate war politics.

The essay outlines the interconnections between war and society within polities, starting from infrastructure through structure to transpolity relations. The author cites single exemplary cases to illustrate each point, drawing on applicable information from this volume. While the fit between the paradigm and the cases presented in the volume varies, the essay suggests that anthropological theory could provide areas for further historical research. Additionally, some issues raised in the volume suggest that the paradigm could be extended beyond the scope of tribal peoples. In conclusion, the essay provides a unified summary of the points from both parts as they apply to the cases presented in the volume.

### Intrapolity Infrastructure

The impact of war on sociocultural systems within polities is an area of investigation that requires attention. The physical characteristics of a society, including subsistence practices and the way food is obtained, play a crucial role in shaping the nature of violent conflicts. This is exemplified in various cases in this volume. For instance, hunters are able to utilize their hunting skills and weapons to engage in violent conflicts. The techniques of hunting could be viewed as a preadaptation to war. Similarly, nomadic pastoralists can strike at a distance, and their livestock provides an incentive for raiding. Empire builders have recognized the value of such life experience and employed specialized units of archers and riders from their peripheral regions.

In societies where farming is the main occupation, even farm implements can become weapons. Peasant farmers can also make up armies. In the New Guinea highlands, where pig husbandry is central to their culture, it permeates the processes of war. Thefts and garden damage generate conflicts and grudges, exchanges and debts of pigs knit together allies, the size of herds affects the timing of war and return to peace, and so forth. In interriverine Amazonia, where gardening must be supplemented by hunting, extensive uninhabited hunting ranges between villages encourage sneak attacks and ambushes. The productivity of agriculture and its frequent assignment as women's work may free men for extended military operations, sentry duties, and role specialization as warriors.

In summary, the physical and cultural characteristics of a society have a significant impact on the nature of war within polities. The relationship between subsistence practices and violent conflicts is especially notable. These observations suggest new areas for investigation that extend beyond earlier discussions of the relationships between war and society.

The impact of war on societies is closely tied to their means of subsistence and survival, as this volume illustrates. The methods used for extracting food from nature can be seen as a preadaptation to war, as hunters may use their skills to hunt men, and nomadic pastoralists may raid other settlements for their livestock. Peasant farmers may also use their farm implements as weapons. The productivity of agriculture and its assignment as women's work may free men for extended military operations and specialization as warriors. State armies of cultivators exhibit a pronounced seasonality of combat, as seen in various empires such as the Aztecs, Japan, Macedonia, and Rome. Specialized soldier armies and the development of military technology and organization were made possible by the freeing of hoplites in Sparta and the institution of pay for military service in Macedonia and Rome. As expanding empires generate food surpluses, huge armies are supported, but the cost of supplying grain can also be a limiting factor in expansion. When soldiers are removed from food production during their time of active duty, an important watershed is passed. In some ancient societies such as Egypt, China, and the Middle East, soldiers were also regularly called upon to perform productive labor, including agriculture. The overlap between military and labor drafts merits further study, particularly in determining if professional soldiers were also put to such work.

Checklist of questions to ask of a society based on observations made in the previous paragraph: 

- 1. What is the primary means of subsistence in the society?
- 2. Are there groups within the society that rely on hunting, pastoralism, or farming for their livelihood?
- 3. Are there any indications that the skills used for subsistence have been adapted for warfare?
- 4. Are men or women primarily responsible for agriculture, and does this impact military operations?
- 5. Are there any examples of state armies that exhibit seasonality in combat, and how does this relate to agriculture?
- 6. Have specialized soldier armies or military technology and organization been developed in the society, and if so, what factors made this possible?
- 7. Has the society experienced expansion due to food surpluses, and if so, how has this impacted military operations?
- 8. Have soldiers been removed from food production during their time of active duty, and if so, what impact did this have on the society?
- 9. Were soldiers ever called upon to perform productive labor, including agriculture, and were professional soldiers also put to such work?
- 10. Are there any other factors related to the impact of war on the society that should be considered?

Tribal wars, in terms of their objectives, are not always generated by critical scarcity of subsistence resources, although scarcity of game animals or land have been argued to be the cause of wars in certain contexts. However, these theories have been challenged, and it seems that such wars are more unusual than commonly imagined. Nonetheless, land can become an attractive target as production systems develop and invest more labor in it, particularly when political structures are advanced enough to incorporate the bounty of land and its tillers into tribute or tax. In situations where physical space is at issue in war by noncentralized polities, it often involves more concentrated and critical resources than cropland. For example, competition for limited water sources in arid environments may have been the root of collective violence among some simple hunter-gatherers in ancient southern California and northern Australia. In addition, sharp local concentrations of particularly valuable resources, such as mouths of salmon streams with rich marine zones and ample stored food on the Pacific Northwest coast, can invite raids generation after generation. Access to materials such as gems and metal ores is typically dealt with through trade rather than war, even in advanced chiefdoms. Therefore, it appears that the causes of tribal wars are diverse and context-specific, and not solely determined by scarcity of resources or land.

In the societies under examination, the acquisition of land and resources played a crucial role in various ways. While Egypt focused on acquiring gold mines and quarries, Athenians were constantly engaged in war to control mines and timber in Thrace. Similarly, scarcity of precious farmland led to battles among ancient Greeks, where hoplites fought for their land. Shang armies were sent to capture and prepare farm fields, while Romano-Germanic wars were fought to seize control of agricultural systems. The availability of farmland was often used as an incentive to motivate soldiers in various civilizations, and having title to land was sometimes linked to an inherited duty of military service. The creation of farming military colonies was also a common practice, for strategic defense and to produce a base of recruits. Territorial character of states added a new dimension regarding land, where border defense became a primary task of the army. Among early Greek poleis and Mesoamerican city-states, constant jostling over land led to the development of distinct borders that were subject to military adjudication. In comparison, the war of ancient and medieval states appears to be more territorial than that of non-state peoples.

### People

In certain historical contexts, scarcity of resources was not limited to land or other material goods, but also extended to people themselves. In North America, for example, indigenous peoples were often captured for forced labor, marriage, or to replace lost individuals. Similarly, colonial Ibero-America relied heavily on forcibly appropriated indigenous labor, while the Atlantic slave trade represents a stark example of the exploitation of enslaved Africans. The Sulu Sultanate of the Philippines in the nineteenth century also relied on slave labor.

The capture of large numbers of slaves was common in ancient and medieval societies around the eastern Mediterranean, where Sparta, for example, rose to prominence on the backs of slaves. The reign of the Abbasids also depended on a constant supply of enslaved tribesmen-warriors from their periphery. In Japan, the scarcity of labor due to epidemics and other disasters led to a series of population crashes from the eighth to the eleventh century, resulting in extreme violence used to make peasants work the land. Old Kingdom Egypt and other ancient societies also relocated defeated populations where they would be more useful. Furthermore, skilled craftsmen of defeated cities were often counted as booty by Hittites.

### Populations 

Population numbers determined the maximum size of armed forces in these societies. While non-state groups could produce forces numbering only in the dozens, larger confederacies could field armies of a thousand or more. Increasing scale of polities corresponded with more sophisticated military practices, as evidenced by cross-cultural statistics. Ancient and medieval societies fielded armies starting at several thousand and reaching hundreds of thousands, allowing for more complex military tactics. Imperial centers, such as the Aztecs and the Athenian Delian League, were able to create professional armies with a variety of fighters well beyond what individual city-states could muster. The Carolingian empire expanded through its ability to mobilize overwhelming numbers, and the expanded field armies of ninth-century conquests were similarly large in scale.

Anthropology has long been interested in the impact of war on populations. Early theories from the 1960s and 1970s suggested that war was an adaptive mechanism that slowed population growth and redistributed people to create a sustainable balance with nature. However, further analysis has revealed maladaptive effects of war, such as forced nucleations, large danger zones that cannot be exploited, and the breakdown of social structures that contributed to collective provisioning. More recent studies have shown that war can have mixed effects on populations. For example, in Chinese Warring States, general Bai Qi executed 400,000 prisoners, which could be a major demographic factor. War led to the devastation and abandonment of many cities in Asia Minor after A.D. 640 and played a significant role in the demographic collapse of some Maya regions after A.D. 700. War may also indirectly impact demographics by reducing agricultural production. For instance, under Masakado, Japanese armies practiced a scorched-earth policy against their noble enemies’ peasant foot soldiers, which may have contributed to population decline. On the other hand, the Great King of Persia strongly encouraged a high birth rate to produce more soldiers. Additionally, the presence of Roman imperial armies stimulated agriculture in a region, and in medieval Western Europe, the army was used to expand cultivation, and destruction of crops was diligently avoided.

### Fortifications 

In the study of war, fortifications have long been a key area of interest. Among non-state societies, fortifications are widespread and siege tactics have been observed, albeit infrequently. While fortifications have been found in many parts of the world, there are interesting variations in their prevalence and design. For example, Mesoamerican fortifications may be more common than previously thought, but they are limited compared to those in other parts of the world. In Middle Kingdom Egypt, a dense network of forts was established along the southern frontier, while in China, walls around villages developed into sophisticated fortifications during the early Bronze Age. These walls were resistant to rudimentary siege techniques until the Eastern Zhou period. During the later Roman Empire, fort building intensified as part of a defense-in-depth strategy, and Romano-German polities continued this trend by constructing larger and more advanced forts using engineering techniques that they did not develop themselves. The presence of these massive structures necessitated the development of the logistical systems of siege warfare. It is possible that the absence of fortifications in Mesoamerica is due to the limited logistical resources available to Imperial armies in the region, or it may be a response to the development of pastoralist raiding in other parts of the world.

### Weaponry 

The technology of weaponry has been a crucial factor in shaping military practices and a reflection of the overall level of technological advancement. The development of specialized weapons and armor has occurred even with relatively simple technologies, as evident in the shortening of the Zulu spear for close combat infantry. Weapons technology and combat practices go hand in hand, and changes in one lead to changes in the other. The introduction of guns during European colonialism transformed the practice of war by indigenous peoples, leading to varying trajectories of military development on Africa's west coast.

The interaction of technology, combat practices, and military organization is a prominent theme in academic history. Japan's evolution of weapons and armor beyond what non-state peoples could attain is an example, as illustrated by the comparison with the peoples of the Pacific Northwest. The long history of Chinese warfare shows technological innovation, borrowings and continuities, differentiation of elite and mass arms, the importance of overall technological level, and the greater significance of troop preparation over technology alone. The Greek hoplite exemplifies the interaction of technological changes with changes in formation and tactics. Philip of Macedon equipped the hoplite phalanx with the extraordinarily long sarissa, allowing his armies to best more conventionally armed foes. However, the Roman soldiers armed with short swords, organized into flexible manipular units that could take advantage of broken terrain, ended the dominance of this system.

The Greek trireme is the most extensively discussed technological development in the text. It required a large and intensively trained crew and was a marvel that led to intensified efforts to extract revenue within and outside the Delian League, structural changes, and continuous hegemonic thrust.

### Gender 

The topic of gender is a crucial but widely overlooked aspect of military history. It is a fact that, in almost all societies, combat has been regarded as men’s work, with few exceptions (Adams 1983). The division of labor in tribal societies often assigns tasks requiring greater strength and stamina to men, while others argue that tasks incompatible with pregnancy and child-rearing go to men (Kelekna 1994). This gendered division of labor is foundational to war-making, and it necessitates specialized training from an early age (Briant 108, 113-114; Meggitt 1977.61-64). Additionally, emotional dispositions appropriate to combat must be inculcated in males (Koch 1974b.166). The readiness for war, therefore, becomes a central component of male identity and gender relations (Divale and Harris 1976). The absence of female warriors is a notable feature of this book, with very few exceptions (Yates 13). Though not discussed in this book, the interaction of military roles and gender relations is an essential aspect of all societies. For example, the prohibition of women from inheriting land in late Roman law may have been a measure to ensure a steady supply of landed soldiers (Bachrach 286).


### Intrapolity Structure

### Internal Social Organization 

The institutionalized patterns of personal interaction play a crucial role in the processes that lead up to and through war, and are responsible for much of the military variations that occur during normal historical times. The structure of society can be divided into three components, namely social organization, economics, and politics, which will each be examined in detail.

The social organization or structure of a society plays a significant role in determining how groups are formed and how men can be mobilized and sent to war. In tribal societies, social organization is largely based on kinship and includes socially defined categories of people and patterned relationships between them. Marriage, postmarital residence, and unilineal descent groups are important elements of social organization that affect military mobilization. Marriage can foster solidarity and cooperation among men, but it can also be a source of conflict. Postmarital residence can either create fraternal interest groups, leading to local violence, or crosscutting ties that encourage broader solidarity, which is useful for wars over longer distances. Unilineal descent groups provide another form of unification, with patrilineality associated with segmentary systems and matrilineality with more permanent tribal unions.

Non-kin sodalities, age grades, and men’s houses also affect the collectivities of males that can be brought together in war parties. However, it is important to note that recruitment does not follow mechanical structural lines, as war leaders use their skills to enlarge their personal followings. War can also have a significant effect on social organization, as protracted and intensive wars can destroy complex social structures linking extended networks of people.

The following passage discusses the role of social organization in classical theory and the emergence of class as the main frame of social organization. The stratification of society is examined across different societies, including Classic Maya, Shang China, Fourth Dynasty Egypt, and the Roman patricians, with a focus on the distinct separation of local elites from the commoners. Although stratification is linked with class, kinship and descent continue to play significant roles among elites in terms of solidarity, alliance, and succession. For instance, intermarriage and patrilineal inheritance were frequent bases of solidarity and rule among the Maya and Shang. Succession disputes, which conferred control over people and resources, may have been a primary reason for war among the Maya. In developed empires, such as the Aztecs and Persians, inherited claims to rule were still crucial but were ratified or overturned by martial prowess. The passage also notes that while social organization can affect military recruitment and outcomes, recruitment does not follow strictly along structural lines.


### Local Social Organization

The role of local social organization in state military mobilizations has been a consistent theme throughout history. In the incipient states, lineage organization was the military order, and it remained evident in Maya and Shang armies. By the Springs and Autumns period in China, the draft had been bureaucratized down to five-family units, with local men kept together as soldiers. The Greek hoplites and geographically based Aztec units likely brought along a lot of back-home social relations, including kinship. In contrast, the Roman Republican army brought together soldiers from all over but gave them a new and enduring social structure in army squadrons. The mobilization of local forces by Rome's western successor states reflected the complex social-institutional landscape of medieval society.

Although social organization plays a role in military formations, stratification remains overwhelmingly important. Soldiers can be divided into two tiers, elite and mass, with the elite soldiers being supported by the mass soldiers. This is evident in the splendid Maya warrior depicted in art, who may have done most of the fighting, but was likely supported by his peasants. Similarly, Shang kings had a few hundred elite, specially equipped zhong troops, and maybe three thousand ren from the general population. Japan and Macedonia before Philip both had elite mounted troops and a mass army that would flee at first trouble. Archaic Greeks also had a mounted elite and infantry, but this infantry would fight. The balance between archaic "knights" and emergent hoplites is a crucial and controversial issue in the development of Greek democracy.

Both Macedonians and the Roman Republican army combined a mounted elite and farmer hoplites, with poorer citizens or landless mercenaries as light skirmishers. As the Western Roman Empire declined, a distinction between elite and mass troops became fundamental once again. In ascendant Byzantium, the same distinction is evident, although within a more complex diversity of soldiers. While there is little mention of a revolt of the militarized masses against the elite, the integration of both strata in armies, with the clear superiority of elite forces, may have kept the masses in line.


 Military service hindered revolution in another way. A significant commonality observed in various historical cases was that war presented an opportunity for men, from lower social classes, to achieve social mobility. The successful and surviving military man could enjoy a permanent, often inheritable, improvement in social and material status. This advantage of upward mobility provided a great incentive for fighters from lower strata and increased the stability of the existing stratification system. The expansion of military forces and campaigns necessitated the development of a broad literate bureaucracy in several ancient societies, including New Kingdom Egypt, Han China, and Carolingian Western Europe.

Armies are formal institutions that stand in defined relationships to institutions of civil administration and organized religion. The variable interrelationships of these three institutional systems have been crucial determinants of social formations since the first civilizations. The historical cases demonstrate both the variability and social importance of this triadic balance. For example, in Chinese history, the demands of armies fostered growth of governmental institutions that later became "civilized," with the military given a subordinate social position. In Japan, a military and civil nobility were differentiated, with the former prevented from occupying the highest decision-making posts. The Abbasids were military rulers of the state, but they left much of civil society to somewhat antimilitary clerics. In Sparta and Athens, the military and civilian rule were closely linked because soldier-citizens dominated government. In post-Roman western Europe, religious and civil institutions were distinct but coordinated, and both doubled as military administrations. The Byzantine and Egyptian cases demonstrate complexities in changing relations between military and political institutions that are beyond the scope of this summary. Future studies of war and society may identify regularities in this triadic relationship, which is a vital aspect of the social organization of states.

The following passage discusses the relationship between war and the distribution of goods and services within societies. While anthropology has not delved deeply into this topic, the way in which goods and services are provided and distributed will impact how scarcity is experienced in different social positions. Economic structures can generate scarcities and demands beyond subsistence needs that lead to war, as seen among the cattle-raiding Nuer in the demands of bride price payments. War can also affect economies, as lineage chiefs on the Pacific Northwest coast had to spur production and commoners accept a centralized economy in order to amass food and wealth for military allies. In stratified societies, scarcities may not be experienced directly by elite decision-makers, but can result in political unrest, as was the case during Roman expansion. Isocrates described a growing gap between rich and poor that generated a surfeit of landless mercenaries, and Alexander’s thrust through Persia was motivated by the need to redirect these men elsewhere.

### Internal Politics

While anthropology has focused on the internal political dimensions of war, little attention has been paid to its economic impacts. In non-state societies, leaders can manipulate deliberations, but are often bound by consensus. The influence of leaders is tied to the social organization and economic circumstances that create groups to be led. The absence of authoritative third parties can escalate localized conflicts into war. In relatively egalitarian societies, most men make their own decisions about participating in an attack, while women have varying but lesser roles in decision-making. However, war is primarily seen as men's work. Anthropologists have noted that the development of more expansive and cohesive polities cuts down on localized fighting.

### Leadership 

In the context of war, leadership plays an important role, as leaders are given more authority and responsibility to make decisions. Even in relatively egalitarian societies, more aggressive or recognized war chiefs may be handed over considerable authority (Kracke 1978.76-79, Moore 1990.323-24). During times of war, leaders must carefully balance internal factional alignments and oppositions with external alliances and conflicts (Ferguson 1995b.295-305), and may act despotically in situations of endemic conflict (Feil 1987.103-11). While leaders take special risks in war, they also receive special benefits, such as wealth, status, and influence, which may lead to the emergence of military entrepreneurs (Brown 1978.197). Successful leaders often use their influence to promote self-beneficial courses of action (Sillitoe 1978, 253-54).

However, the influence of simple war leaders typically recedes with the restoration of peace, and self-aggrandizing men may stir up trouble to generate continuing support and use periods of war to modify political structures to their own lasting benefit (Kracke 1978.77-80). War can act as an evolutionary ratchet that promotes incremental elaboration of centralization and hierarchy (Ferguson 1994.102), leading to violent conflict over succession to high positions (Crumley 1981.255). With the development of tribute, leaders may require successful wars just to remain in power (Wolf 1987.141-44).

Decision-making in war varies greatly, with early Maya retaining vestiges of the vertical integration of pre-state days, while Homeric groups may have been chiefdoms where the mixture of hierarchy and consensus in decision making was normal (Webster 348, Raaflaub 129, 139). In classical times, democracy emerged, and decisions on war were made by those who would fight, although this did not extend to slaves (Cohen 1984.344-51). The conquering Muslim armies began as relatively egalitarian tribal forces, but within half a century, rule by a consensus of chiefs gave way to centralized coercive rule over a demilitarized population (Crone 313-314, 316-317). The command of Macedonian kings was tempered by close noble "companions" before Philip II, but decision-making power concentrated in one charismatic leader in Alexander's rolling conquests (Hamilton 167, 173, Briant 105). Major imperial expansions are typically associated with powerful individual rulers (Sinopoli 1994.163), but the "routine" autocrats of Imperial Rome generally eschewed grand adventures for more conservative military policies (Campbell 218, 229-230).


Military conflicts and conquests have played a significant role in shaping the internal politics and social hierarchy of various societies throughout history. In ancient Egypt, military victories were instrumental in advancing the position and status of military leaders, both as individuals and as a class (Gnirs 79, 85-86, 90-91). Similarly, ambitious men in Achaemenid Persia and Rome sought to elevate their political standing through military conquests (Briant 115-116; Rosenstein 200, 205, 210). Maya wars were often driven by the competition among different contenders for high positions that granted control over land and labor (Webster 350-352).

In some cases, external military defeats had adverse effects on the internal political stability of a society. The Aztec court, for instance, experienced political scheming following a defeat, while Byzantium witnessed factional fighting (Hassig 372-374; Haldon 246). In contrast, the threat posed by distant enemies enabled Athenian leaders to transform the Delian League from a voluntary confederacy into a centrally-controlled empire, thereby enhancing political stability (Raaflaub 131-132, 144-145).

The use of military conflicts to establish and maintain political power was not limited to ancient times. Lord Shang, for example, employed a state of perpetual warfare to eliminate his rivals and establish an empire (Yates 26-27). In Ramesside Egypt, military victories were essential to preserving political stability and power (Gnirs 88-90), and the Aztec kings' reign was dependent on regular tributary payments (Hassig 373).

However, military conflicts were not always detrimental to a society's internal politics. In archaic Greece, citizen participation in military affairs was instrumental in institutionalizing egalitarian structures (Raaflaub 140). In summary, external military affairs have had a significant impact on the internal politics and social hierarchies of various societies throughout history.


The relationship between internal and external politics in war is complex, as various nested arenas of political organization, from local communities to larger political universes, each have their own relationships and rules. Political interests in any given situation reflect this vertical integration, as well as the more obvious horizontal, interpolity relations. Conflict can result in the fusion or fissure of polities along a variety of social organizational lines, making internal become external or vice versa. Sovereignty, a major element in political ideologies, particularly of states, may be qualified, contingent, and contested, within networks of political relationships.

While anthropology has not extensively explored other aspects of the connections between war and society that are specific to state-level polities, there are three aspects of state-level military force worth noting. One hallmark of a state is its ability to compel men to fight, even on pain of death. States are also distinctive in their ability to suppress independent military initiatives by local forces, although the state's monopoly on legitimate force may be more complete in ideology than in practice. Finally, state armies often act as highly coercive internal police.

The state's ability to compel men to fight is a fundamental aspect of state-level military force. Various governments throughout history have used different methods to ensure military service, often combining population records and harsh punishments. For example, in Warring States China, all men between the ages of sixteen and sixty were called to serve in the army. Japanese district magistrates were given wide powers to compel peasants to serve in armies from the eighth century onwards. In Egypt, mass recruitment was practiced, and desertion was countered with the devastation of deserters' families. Persia, despite its valorization of the warrior life, still used drastic measures against parents who tried to keep their sons out of the army. The Roman Empire and its successors also struggled with problems of mass mobilization, including occasional use of decimation as a disciplinary measure. Military obedience was critical, and soldiers' lives depended on it. This ability to compel military service is a significant difference between state and non-state societies. The relationship between the state's monopoly on the legitimate use of force and its ability to compel service is a hallmark of state-level political organization.

The ability of a polity to suppress independent war-making by local strong men has been subject to variation throughout history. In earlier non-state societies, groups like the Homeric could not suppress raids by ambitious individuals, and such conflicts could spread to involve entire groups, as in the Trojan War. Later, poleis struggled to suppress private wars. Muslim rulers did not claim a monopoly on violence, and their subjects often resorted to arms in their own interests. Egyptian pharaohs claimed sole prerogative to use violence, but control collapsed in intermediate periods, and was hard won back. The Western Zhou king claimed the exclusive right to raise an army, but many local elites did so anyway. Later Han imperialists eliminated local military powers, only to lose control again later. In Japan, the Chinese-style state attempted to centralize military control but could not sustain the costs and reverted to more localized forces. The early Roman Empire had a true monopoly on force, with independent local powers eliminated. Byzantine and Romano-German successors of the western Roman Empire both saw localization of forces followed by recentralization. The changing balance between central and local control of war-making is a central historical dynamic throughout the chapters of this book, and it may be related to declining marginal returns for investment with increasing complexity.

In the study of ancient armies, it is often taken for granted that these forces served as internal police, but this assumption requires closer examination. Across different societies, there are structural variations in the role of military forces in maintaining internal order. For example, the Spartan hoplite assembly emerged as a response to the threat posed by a large number of slaves, while in Japan, the military was used to prevent peasants from fleeing and to keep them working in fear. In Egypt, Ramesside army units were stationed at important civil institutions to maintain order and suppress riots, and in Arab regions, armies became local gendarmes as the central army shifted focus to internal order maintenance. The Roman Army had urban police units and relied heavily on occupied lands for garrisons, while in the early Middle Ages, elite-led rural forces defended against barbarian invaders and local brigands. Warring States China had the most elaborate system of militarized policing, with the administrative structure used to draft soldiers and corvée laborers also serving as a means for compulsory self-policing. The internal policing role of ancient armies requires further investigation.

### Intrapolity Superstructure

The concept of superstructure is concerned with the mental world, encompassing cultural psychology and the ways in which cultural values, ideologies, and beliefs shape the behavior of societies during wartime. This area has received extensive attention from anthropologists studying war, ranging from early works that explain war as an expression of cultural values to more recent studies detailing local logics of war. However, the papers collected here focus less on superstructural variables. Ethnographic studies suggest that chronic warfare is often associated with belligerent and aggressive male personalities, although individuals with the hottest heads are frequently excluded from actual decisions to fight. Child-rearing patterns, including close association of boys with their mothers, followed by a switch to expectations of manliness, are linked to an adult tendency toward violent behavior. Children may be trained directly in hostility and encouraged to give tit for tat. Value systems will conform to war, honoring the warrior and shaming those who will not fight. Social rewards of prestige and even marriage partners may flow to the brave. The addition of the warrior role to the male role set has repercussions for gender relations and may be associated with ideologies of male supremacy and other male-centered values and institutions. Nonetheless, gender relations among warring peoples vary considerably, linked to other factors, such as the importance of intragender cooperation in critical labor. For example, the Iroquois, known for their warlike nature, accorded substantial respect and political power to women.

In medieval western Europe, military skills were a fundamental part of education, with young children being taught them from an early age. Similarly, in Warring States China, becoming a man was symbolized by the act of donning a sword. The Achaemenid Persians started their military education at the age of five and marked the passage to warrior status with great honors for those who displayed bravery in battle. Ancient and classical Greece considered the true citizen to be a farmer-soldier, with emphasis placed on martial valor. Sparta is particularly well-known for its highly militarized child-rearing practices. In tenth-century Japan, warrior classes developed an elaborate warrior ethos through military specialization. Writing provided an entirely new medium for the glorification of war and warriors, as was evident in Egypt. As written traditions evolved, they gained more complex perspectives, as in propagandist accounts reflecting Persian dynastic struggles. War literatures became important sources of information about military practice and subject to all the inherent issues of textual interpretation, as seen in the case of the Trojan War.

In the context of war, what distinguishes killing from murder is the presence of social justification. This is achieved through a set of beliefs and values that are upheld by each warring faction. While beliefs related to witchcraft and revenge are sometimes associated with barbarism, they can also be seen as a manifestation of psychological processes that take place prior to war. These beliefs serve to make killing morally acceptable and can be used to persuade others or oneself of the legitimacy of an attack. Additionally, they provide strength and courage to soldiers who face death. Witchcraft beliefs are employed to assign blame for problems affecting a group, with specialists often identifying a source that is already known to be hostile. Individuals identified as witches are then condemned and subject to severe punishment or elimination. This demonization of the enemy is a common feature of war, and accusations of witchcraft can be interpreted as a literal manifestation of this principle. In some cases, a public accusation of witchcraft may even provoke a declaration of war in a highly charged atmosphere.

In the context of war, the distinction between murder and killing lies in the social justification provided for the latter. This justification is facilitated by the beliefs and values prevalent in the society at war, which make killing morally acceptable and legitimize attacks. Witchcraft and revenge are commonly viewed as indicators of savagery, but they can also be interpreted as psychological exercises that precede war and take on strong meanings and values. Witchcraft is used to identify the enemy and blame them for problems affecting the group, while revenge is invoked to justify attacks by portraying the intended victims as the instigators. These beliefs provide a moral basis for war and serve as powerful symbols for mobilizing public opinion.

Revenge motivation is not the sole driving force behind war, and retaliation strikes are often carried out for tactical reasons. Reasons for revenge are often constructed, overlooked, or negotiated out of existence based on circumstances, but every raid is justified as revenge. Warring societies often project war as inherent in life through history, myth, spiritual beliefs, and cosmological views. In ancient Egyptian political ideology, war was seen as a response to enemy provocations, while in Byzantium, it was essential for the state's image to punish outside troublemakers. Similarly, Caesar claimed to defend the ancestral constitution of the Republic when he led his army against Rome, sparking the civil war that ended the empire. The discussion of political and moral justifications for war in ancient and medieval states often leads to the role of organized religion.

It has been widely recognized that religion plays a significant role in various aspects of human life such as societal well-being, uncertainty, danger, pain, loss, and injustice. Given the nature of war, it is unsurprising that it is closely intertwined with religion, which often provides moral and political justifications for military conflicts. In several ancient cultures, war was legitimized through religious beliefs and practices, such as in the Aztec and Persian cultures, where myths and rituals were created to justify war. Similarly, in ancient China, war was considered a part of divine order, and conquest was legitimized by Heaven. Greek and Roman religions were also closely intertwined with war.

In many cases, state ideologies fused military leadership, religion, and the right to rule. For instance, in ancient Egypt, the king was considered divine, and legitimacy was demonstrated through victory in war. The gods of Persia assigned the king the duty of protecting his subjects from outside enemies. In Japan, the Yamato dynasty developed lineages that intertwined conquest and divinity. Military leaders in ancient Macedonia were both war leaders and representatives of the gods. In the Western Roman Empire and beyond, military leaders were representatives of god, and Christian just-war doctrine developed in a context of pervasive militarism.

However, some scholars have questioned the depth of the religious commitment to war in some cultures, as religion may have been manipulated by elites or adopted superficially by the general population. For example, medieval Islamic holy war was sometimes waged by non-Muslims who were imported and converted for that purpose and initiated by state officials who were often at odds with the clerics.

Throughout history, religion has played a significant role in warfare, often intertwined with ritual and magic. Before and during wars, collective ceremonies are held to bolster the resolve of soldiers and to distinguish violent ways from daily life. Shinto priests who accompanied invading forces were an example of this practice. Supernatural means are employed to predict the outcome of battles, and shamans use their skills to weaken or confuse the enemy. Divination techniques, such as the consultation of oracle bones, guided the armies of the Shang dynasty in China, and ancestral spirits watched over expeditions during the time of Confucius and Sun Tzu. Oaths of blood brotherhood and loyalty were taken to maintain alliances, and war captives often faced ritual sacrifice in many cultures, including the Aztecs and Assyrians. Military success was believed to bring spiritual benefits in many societies.

This connection between war and culture has been demonstrated throughout history. Wars have shaped cultures just as much as cultures have shaped wars. This section of the paper has explored the ways in which religion has influenced warfare within a single polity, tracing the connections from subsistence to divinity. The next section will similarly argue that the space between war-making polities is far from empty and is also shaped by the existence of war.
