## Historical Timelines

A historical timeline can be stored in a tree-like database.

Whereas the highest levels of the tree have the broadest periodizations,
the lowest levels have detailed periodizations over short periods of time
(and in the limit when reconstructing the Battle of Waterloo, for instance, 
the timeline can redcue to hours and minutes).

The focus here is the historical period covered by the [Razadarit epic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razadarit)
during the ['Forty Years War'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_Years%27_War) 
that lasted roughly from 1385 to 1424 (see [my study](https://web.archive.org/web/20090219063323/http://web.soas.ac.uk/burma/4.1files/4.1fernquest.pdf)).
