## Historical Timelines

A historical timeline can be stored in a tree-like database.

The highest levels of the tree have the broadest and longest periodizations.

The lowest levels have detailed periodizations over short periods of time.

In the limit the timeline reduces to hours and minutes, for instance in detailed reconstructions of battles such as the Battle of Waterloo. 

The focus here is the historical period covered by the [Razadarit epic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razadarit)
during the ['Forty Years War'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_Years%27_War) 
that lasted roughly from 1385 to 1424 (see [my study](https://web.archive.org/web/20090219063323/http://web.soas.ac.uk/burma/4.1files/4.1fernquest.pdf)).
