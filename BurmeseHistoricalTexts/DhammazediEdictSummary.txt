The Treatise on the Lineage of Elders (Vamsadipani)

The historical text 'The Treatise on the Lineage of Elders (Vamsadipani)' written in the 18th century, provides many biographical details regarding King Ramadhipati and describes his monastic reforms.

King Ramadhipati's edict on Dhammavinaya stipulated that certain individuals, such as criminals, opponents of the king, and those with physical or mental impairments, should not be made novices. The higher ordination required informing the monastic authorities and the king, with punishment threatened for those who did not follow this protocol. The edict also addressed monks who engaged in unbecoming activities, such as practicing medicine or astrology, carpentry or ivory carving, and raising cattle or cultivating land, and forbade them from dwelling in monasteries. Monks who exhibited strong faith and followed the rules were permitted to reside in monasteries. Finally, the edict provided guidelines for ordaining novices, including teaching them to read and recite before ordaining them, and teaching them a summary of the four virtues to be observed by monks before conferring the higher ordination.

He then dispatched a message to those who kept gold, silver, and other properties, exhorting them to give up their wealth and follow the rule. While some monks gave up their properties and practiced well, others who were unable to do so were ordered to return to lay life. Monks guilty of grave offenses were also ordered unfrocked, as were those who engaged in commerce or other activities deemed inappropriate for monks. Through these efforts, King Ramadhipati succeeded in purifying and unifying the Sasana in the Ramanna country.
